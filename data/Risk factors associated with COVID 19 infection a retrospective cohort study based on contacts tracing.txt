of COVID‐19 infection.  Total word count: 4941 Objectives To  es‐
timate  the  attack  rates,  and  identify  the  risk  factors of
COVID‐19 infection.  Methods  Based  on  a  retrospective  cohort
study,  we  investigated  11,580  contacts  of  COVID‐19 cases in
Guangdong Province from January 10 to March 15,  2020.  All  con‐
tacts  were  tested  by RT‐PCR to detect their infection of SARS‐
COV‐2. Attack rates by characteristics were calculated,  and  lo‐
gistic regression was used to estimate the risk factors of infec‐
tion for COVID‐19.  Results A total of  515  of  11,580  contacts
were  identified  to  be  infected  with SARS‐COV‐2.  Compared to
young adults aged 20‐29 years, the infected risk  was  higher  in
children  (RR: 2.59, 95%CI: 1.79‐3.76), and old people aged 60‐69
years (RR: 5.29, 95%CI: 3.76‐7.46). Females also had  higher  in‐
fected risk (RR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.39‐2.00). People having close re‐
lationship with index cases encountered higher risk to be infect‐
ed  (RR  for spouse: 20.68, 95%CI: 14.28‐29.95; RR for non‐spouse
family members: 9.55, 95%CI: 6.73‐13.55; RR for close  relatives:
5.90,  95%CI:  4.068.59;  RR  for  other  relatives: 3.37, 95%CI:
2.15‐5.28). Moreover, contacts exposed to index case  in  sympto‐
matic period (RR: 2.15, 95%CI: 1.67‐2.79), with critically severe
symptoms (RR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.00‐2.57),  with  symptoms  of  dizzy
(RR:   1.58,   95%CI:   1.08‐2.30),  myalgia  (RR:  1.49,  95%CI:
1.15‐1.94), and chill (RR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.05‐1.92) had higher in‐
fected risks.  Conclusion Children, old people, females and fami‐
ly members are susceptible to be infected  with  COVID‐19,  while
index  cases  in  incubation period had lower contagiousness. Our
findings will be helpful for developing targeted  prevention  and
control  strategies to combat the worldwide pandemic.  Key words:
COVID‐19; attack rate; risk factors; close contact;  China  Since
the  Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak on 31 December,
2019 [1], it has hit more than 200 countries, areas  or  territo‐
ries  with 8,525,042 cases and 456,973 deaths as of June 20, 2020
[2]. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID‐19  as  a
pandemic  on  March  11,2020  [3]. Owing to the effective measure
taken in China, the chain of transmission has been broken and the
epidemic has been under control.  Contact tracing is a major pub‐
lic health response to imports of  rare  or  emerging  infectious
diseases.  The main objectives of contact tracing are to identify
potentially infected individuals before onset of severe symptoms,
and to prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases. Con‐
tact tracing has decisively contributed to the  control  of  many
infectious  diseases worldwide including severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus disease, and Middle East respiratory
syndrome  (MERS)  [4‐7]. Report of the WHO‐China Joint Mission on
COVID‐19 pointed out that China has a policy of  meticulous  case
and contact identification for COVID‐19 [8]. Previous studies us‐
ing mathematical modeling also  theoretically  demonstrated  that
contact  tracing  and quarantine play important roles in control‐
ling the spreading of COVID‐19 [9,10]. In addition to this,  con‐
tact  tracing  also  provides a unique opportunity to investigate
the epidemiological features of  COVID‐19.   Previous  researches
have  analyzed  the data of COVID‐19 patients and found some risk
factors of mortality, such as older age, pre‐existing  cardiovas‐
cular  or  cerebrovascular  diseases,  low  levels of CD3+CD8+ T‐
cells, high levels of cardiac troponin I, higher Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment score and d‐dimer [11,12]. Unfortunately, lim‐
ited study has paid attention to  the  risk  factors  related  to
COVID‐19  infection.  Recent  studies conducted among 1,286 close
contacts (98 of them were infected by SARS‐CoV‐2) in Shenzhen and
among 2098 close contacts in Guangzhou (134 of them were infected
by SARS‐CoV‐2) explored the risk factors for COVID‐19  infection,
like  older age, travelling to Hubei, etc [13,14]. Another recent
study among 2761 close contact of 100  selected  index  cases  in
Taiwan  identified exposure to index case with severe symptoms as
a risk factor [15].  However, their limited  sample  size,  espe‐
cially  the  limited cases, may restrict their ability to perform
detailed analysis, and reduce the  power  to  detect  significant
risk  factors. Additionally, findings within a single city or se‐
lected sample may restrict its ability of generalization.  In the
current study, we employed a large dataset including 11,686 close
contacts of COVID‐19 cases (449 of them were infected) in  Guang‐
dong  Province,  China to estimate the attack rates, and identify
risk factors for infection of  COVID‐19.  Under  the  context  of
worldwide  pandemic,  understanding this issue can identify high‐
risk groups and provide evidence to develop targeted Setting  and
definitions  Guangdong, a province with large population size lo‐
cated in Southern China, is a place early affected  by  COVID‐19.
The  first confirmed case was reported on January 15, 2020, and a
total of 1,361 confirmed cases were reported by March  15,  2020.
Since  the  very early stage of COVID‐19 outbreak, an intensified
surveillance was implemented across Guangdong Province to  detect
suspected  and confirmed COVID‐19 cases, and their close contacts
following standardized protocols released by the National  Health
Commission  of  China. Suspected and confirmed COVID19 cases were
defined based on the Diagnosis and Treatment scheme of  COVID‐19,
and  close  contacts  were  defined by the Prevention and Control
Scheme of COVID‐19. These two schemes Identification and  quaran‐
tine  of contacts Once a suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 case was
identified, the case would be reported as an index case and  iso‐
lated,  and  the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC)
will conduct a field investigation. Information  of  index  cases
was collected by clinical workers, including demographic informa‐
tion, exposure history, clinical symptoms, date of symptom onset,
laboratory  test  results, and the severity. This information was
directly reported to the National Internet‐Based Infectious  Dis‐
eases  Reporting System. Information of contacts was collected by
CDC using a standardized questionnaire, including  general  demo‐
graphic  characteristics,  relationships with the index case, and
patterns and frequency of contract. Meanwhile, their throat swabs
were  collected  and  detected by real‐time reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction assay (RT‐PCR). During the  quarantine,
health  status  of  all  contacts was monitored, and their throat
swabs were collected every several days to test  their  infection
status.  Once  they were identified with positive of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐COV‐2),  they  would  be
transferred to a designated hospital for diagnosis and treatment.
Clinical symptoms and severity of these  infected  contacts  were
followed up and recorded by clinical workers. After 14 days quar‐
antine, contacts with negative SARS‐COV‐2 were released.  Statis‐
tical  analysis  Categorical  variables were described using per‐
centage (%), and a Chi‐square test was used to test  the  differ‐
ences in distributions of categorical variables between index and
secondary cases. If conditions for Chi‐square test were not  sat‐
isfied,  Fishers exact test was used.  Attack rate was calculated
as the percentage of contacts who were later confirmed to be  in‐
fected with SARS‐COV‐2. We estimated the attack rates of contacts
by gender, age, relationships to index cases (household  members,
relatives,  social  activities,  etc.),  transportations (flight,
train, public transportation, provide car, and the Dream  Cruise)
where  infection  occurred, course of disease (incubation period,
symptomatic period, and different days from symptom onset) of in‐
dex  cases  when  the  contact  occurred, severity of index cases
(mild, moderate, severe, and  critically  severe),  and  clinical
symptoms  of index cases. These attack rates were calculated only
using sub‐datasets of the index cases and contacts with  detailed
information  because  some  cases had no complete information for
estimate. Logistic regression was also conducted to estimate  the
risk  factors  of COVID‐19. All data analyses were conducted by R
software (version 3.5.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
General characteristics of contacts As of March 15, 2020, a total
of 11,686 contacts were traced and quarantined. The first contact
was  identified on January 10, 2020. Contacts (n=106) without key
formation  were  excluded,  and  11,580  contacts,  which  peaked
(n=574)  on  January  31.  Of  total contacts, 6,183 (53.4%) were
males; 8,419 (72.7%) were adults  aged  20‐59  years,  and  9,725
(84.0%)  contacts  were  quarantined in centralized stations. The
number of contacts occurred at home,  in  social  activities,  on
transportations,  and in health care settings were 4,893 (41.0%),
2,016 (16.9%), 3,198 (26.5%)  and  1,348  (11.3%),  respectively.
Many  contacts  were  from  family members of index cases (4,707,
40.7%), social activity contacts (3,344,  28.9%),  transportation
contacts  (2,778,  24.0%), and health care workers 7.0‐8.7) close
contacts per index case. The average contacts per index case var‐
ied  with  contact quarantine was 6.4 days, and the average dura‐
tion of quarantine was 9.7 days.  Attack rates of COVID‐19  Until
March 15, 515 (4.4%) contacts were identified to be infected with
SARS‐COV‐2. The attack rates varied by age groups with the  high‐
est  for  the  group aged 60‐69 years (11.1%), and the lowest for
the group of 20‐29 years (2.3%). The attack rate of children < 10
years  was  5.7%,  and  the  attack rates were higher in children
whose index cases aged 30‐39 years (8.5%), and 50‐59 years (7.0%)
We  also  observed a higher attack rate in females (5.6%) than in
males (3.5%). In addition,  contacts  having  close  relationship
with  index  cases had higher attack rate (attack rate: 23.3% for
spouse; 10.6% for non‐spouse family members; 7.0% for close rela‐
tives;  4.1%  for  other relatives, 1.3% for social activity con‐
tacts, etc.). Different attack rates  also  occurred  in  various
transportations  where infection occurred. Attack rates were 0.8%
on flight, 1.2% on train, 2.1% on public transportation, 4.2%  on
private  car and 9.4% on the Dream Cruise (9.4%).  When consider‐
ing the time contacting with the index cases, attack  rates  were
3.3%  and  7.0% when contacts occurred in the index cases incuba‐
tion period and symptomatic period. In detail,  attack  rate  in‐
creased  from five days prior to the symptom onset of index cases
(1.7%), to a peak during 34 days (10.1%) after  onset,  and  then
decreased to 4.0% after 17 days of the onset. In addition, attack
rates increased from 4.6% for the contacts of mild cases to  7.5%
for  the  contacts  of  critically severe and higher attack rates
were observed in index cases with dyspnea (11.2%), dizzy (10.6%),
muscle  soreness  (10.4%), and shortness of breath (10.0%).  Risk
of infection for COVID‐19 Compared with people aged 20‐29  years,
children <10 years (RR: 2.59, 95%CI: 1.79‐3.76) and children aged
10‐19 (RR: 1.81, 95%CI: 1.17‐2.81) had higher risk to be infected
with  COVID‐19  50‐59  years  (RR: 2.30, 95%CI: 1.65‐3.27), 60‐69
years (RR: 5.29, 95%CI: 3.76‐7.46) and  70‐79  years  (RR:  3.03,
95%CI:  1.81‐5.08).  Moreover,  young  adults (aged 30‐39 years),
whose index cases having close relationship with index cases  en‐
countered  higher  risk  to  be  infected  (RR  and  95%CI: 20.68
[14.28‐29.95] for spouse; 9.55 [6.73‐13.55] for non‐spouse family
members;  5.90  [4.06‐8.59]  transportations,  we did not observe
significant difference across various transportations  except  in
When  considering  time  contacting with index cases, the risk of
exposure to index cases in the 2E). More  specifically,  the  in‐
fected  risk  increased  from five plus days prior to the symptom
onset 2F). Moreover, contact with index cases with critically se‐
vere  symptoms  was  associated  with a for the contacts of index
cases with different clinical symptoms  compared  to  fever,  and
there  were  higher  risks  in  index cases with dizzy (RR: 1.58,
95%CI: 1.08‐2.30), myalgia  (RR:  1.49,  95%CI:  1.15‐1.94),  and
chill  (RR:  1.42,  95%CI: 1.05‐1.92).  After reporting the first
case on January 15, 2020, Guangdong Provincial  government  mobi‐
lized  enormous  resources  to  respond to the COVID‐19 epidemic.
More than 11,000 close contacts of COVID‐19 were traced and quar‐
antined. One third of the total cases reported in Guangdong Prov‐
ince were identified from these  contacts,  which  indicate  that
contact  tracing  strategy  have played an important role in con‐
taining the spreading of COVID‐19. The analysis  of  index  cases
and  their  close contacts provides insight into the attack rates
and risk factors of infection for COVID19.  We found that  attack
rates  were  higher  in the elderly with the highest in the group
aged 60‐69 years, and logistic regression demonstrated  the  sta‐
tistical significance. These findings are consistent with the re‐
sults for SARS in Beijing [7]. Recent studies also reported  that
elderly  contacts  were  more observe significant higher infected
risk of elderly contacts, which may ascribe its insufficient sam‐
ple  size [15]. Our findings thus confirmed greater vulnerability
of the elderly. Those contacts aged 6069 years  could  have  more
physical  activities  than  older  people, which may cause closer
contact with index case for a longer period [7].  Meanwhile,  the
immunity  of  the  age  may be weaker than younger adults, making
them more susceptible to infection. Therefore, more  efforts  are
needed  to  protect  the  elderly from the infection of COVID‐19.
The susceptibility  of  children  to  COVID‐19  is  controversial
[8,18].  Clinical  data  of  COVID‐19  considering literatures of
COVID‐19 in children pointed out that children cases are  usually
less  severe than adult cases, and more children cases are asymp‐
tomatic infection, which makes them less opportunity to be tested
and  identified  [21].  However, we found higher infected risk of
COVID‐19 in children <10 years that their  RR  were  larger  than
contacts aged 10‐59 years, which indicates that children were al‐
so susceptible to COVID‐19. Furthermore, we observed a higher at‐
tack  rate  in  children  whose  index cases aged 30‐39 and 50‐59
years. Although limited sample size may cause  insignificant  RR,
our  results still implicated that the children may be mainly in‐
fected by their parents and grandparents. Two recent studies  re‐
ported  consistent  results with our study [13,22]. For instance,
Dong et al. analyzed 2,143  pediatric  COVID‐19  patients  across
China, and found that children were susceptible to COVID‐19 [22].
Additionally, young adults (30‐39 years) were more likely  to  be
years.  These findings may be attributed to the status that young
adults are the primary caregivers once their children and parents
got  sick, and they are also the individuals who have many social
protection both at home and in public places. Compared with  pre‐
vious  studies,  our  study prospectively collected data based on
contacts tracing, which had explicit temporality for  causal  in‐
ference and reduced recall bias, and therefore provide more reli‐
able evidence. Our finding is helpful for preventing people  from
being  infected  with COVID‐19.  We observed that female contacts
were more likely to be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 than male contacts,
which is consistent with previous studies [13,14]. For example, a
recent study conducted in  Guangzhou  also  found  higher  attack
rates  in  females  than in males [14]. This difference in attack
rate between sex may be due to several reasons: (1) females  play
predominant roles as caregivers within family and may have closer
contact and longer contact period with the index cases [23];  (2)
females  comprise a large proportion of health‐care workers [24].
Therefore, our findings suggest more prevention measures specifi‐
cally  implemented  to  protect females from infection during the
epidemic of COVID‐19.  We observed that the relationships between
contacts  and  index  cases  significantly  affected the infected
risks. Compared with the social activity contacts,  the  risk  of
being infected was more than 20 times higher among the spouse and
more than 9 times higher among other family members,  also  found
that more infections were acquired in household [15]. Family mem‐
bers are more likely to have closer contact with index case for a
longer  contact  period  with  shorter distance. Another possible
reason is that family members may have some certain linkage  with
index  cases  in living habits which may cause higher predisposi‐
tion in infection than other close contacts. Unfortunately, indi‐
viduals  commonly  take  protective measures in public place like
washing hands and wearing mask, but neglect  personal  protection
at home. This indicates the necessity for public to pay attention
to personal protective at home especially when family members de‐
velop  symptom or have travel history of epidemic areas.  We also
compared attack rates occurred on different transportations,  and
found  lower attack rates occurred on trains or flights. This re‐
sult indicates that the possibility of transmission of  SARS‐COV2
on flight and train was low, which may be related to the advanced
air purification system and sanitation in these  transportations.
However, after controlling for age and sex, the results of logis‐
tic regression did not find significant difference across various
transportations  except  in the Dream Cruises. The insignificance
may be attributed to the limited sample size and the risk differ‐
ence may actually exist. Future studies with larger sample should
be conducted to explore this issue and provide evidence to  guide
the  development of prevention in transportations.  Although pre‐
vious studies reported that  both  asymptomatic  and  symptomatic
cases could infect other persons [26‐28], the differences in con‐
tagiousness at different phases of COVID‐19 remain  unclear.  Our
study shows the contagiousness peaked during 3‐4 days after symp‐
tom onset, which  is  consistent  with  previous  studies,  which
showed  higher virus shedding during several days after the onset
of symptoms [29‐31]. For example, To et al. found  that  salivary
viral  load  in  COVID‐19 cases was highest during the first week
after symptom onset, and the viral RNA was detected 25 days after
symptom  onset  [31].  In  addition, we found contacts before the
symptom onset could also lead to infection, which  indicates  the
transmission  of  COVID‐19  in  incubation period. Although viral
shedding before symptom onset is still limited, Zou  et  al.  re‐
ported an asymptomatic patient who had similar amount of virus to
those symptomatic cases [30]. Another study conducted in children
also  detected positive virus before onset of symptoms in several
children cases [20]. These findings suggested COVID‐19  could  be
transmitted  before  onset  of symptoms.  The present study found
that severe index cases could cause higher attack rates than mild
cases.  In addition, compared with cases with fever, dizzy, myal‐
gia and chill caused higher infected  risks  to  their  contacts,
while  cases  with  rhinorrhea, expectoration and chest tightness
caused lower infected risks. To et al.s study showed higher virus
load  in  specimens  of  severe patients than mild patients [31],
which verified our findings. However, studies are needed  to  de‐
tect the virus load in cases with different clinical symptoms for
assessing  their  contagiousness.    This   study   has   several
strengths.  First, our study includes the largest number of close
contacts of COVID‐19 to date. Second, our study is  a  retrospec‐
tive  cohort study, which provides information with explicit tem‐
porality for causal inference and the recall  bias  was  reduced.
Third,  we estimated the attack rates and infected risks for dif‐
ferent contacts, which is  helpful  for  identifying  susceptible
groups  to  develop specific protection. Fourth, we estimated the
contagiousness across the course of Some limitations also need to
be  noted. First, although we used a large dataset with more than
ten thousand of contacts, the sample size of cases was limited in
some  subgroups, which may lead to insufficient power to identify
the statistical significance. Second, a  number  of  asymptomatic
infections may be missed and their close contacts cannot be iden‐
tified. Third, since the  imperfect  sensitivity  of  the  RT‐PCR
test,  some  potential  infections  among  close  contacts may be
missed.  Fourth, the data were collected by a variety of epidemi‐
ological  investigation groups across Guangdong Province. Despite
using the same protocol, the implementation  may  have  inconsis‐
tence  and  some  noise may be introduced.  Children, old people,
females and family members are susceptible to  be  infected  with
COVID‐19, while index cases in incubation period had lower conta‐
giousness. Our findings will be helpful for  developing  targeted
prevention and control strategies to combat the worldwide pandem‐
ic.  Ethical approval and consent to participate Data  collection

cases  Considering both the following epidemiological history and
clinical manifestations: Epidemiological history (1)  History  of
travel  to or residence in Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or in
other communities where cases have been reported within  14  days
prior  to  the  onset  of  the disease; (2) In contact with novel
coronavirus infected people (with positive results for the nucle‐
ic  acid  test) within 14 days prior to the onset of the disease;
(3) In contact with patients who have fever or respiratory  symp‐
toms  from  Wuhan  and  its surrounding area, or from communities
where confirmed cases have been reported within  14  days  before
the onset of the disease; or (4) Clustered cases (2 or more cases
with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a small area such Clin‐
ical  manifestations  (1)  Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2)
The aforementioned imaging characteristics of  novel  coronavirus
pneumonia (SARS‐COV‐2); (3) Normal or decreased WBC count, normal
or decreased lymphocyte count in the early  stage  of  A  suspect
case has any of the epidemiological history plus any two clinical
manifestations or all three clinical manifestations if  there  is
no  clear epidemiological history.  Confirmed cases Suspect cases
with one of the following etiological or  serological  evidences:
(1) Real‐time fluorescent RT‐PCR indicates positive for new coro‐
navirus nucleic acid; (2) Viral gene sequence is  highly  homolo‐
gous to known new coronaviruses.  with the acute phase.  1.2 Def‐
inition of close contacts to the index case A contact is a person
who  experienced  any one of the following exposures during the 2
days before and the 14 days after the  onset  of  symptoms  of  a
probable or confirmed case: (1) Face‐to‐face contact with a prob‐
able or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more  than  15  (2)
Direct  physical  contact with a probable or confirmed case.  (3)
Direct care for a patient with  probable  or  confirmed  COVID‐19
disease  without  using  proper personal protective equipment. or
(4) Other situations as  indicated  by  local  risk  assessments.
Note:  for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is
measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days after the  date
on  which  the  sample  was taken which led to confirmation.  1.3
