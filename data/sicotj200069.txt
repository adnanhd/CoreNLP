Abstract – The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our world in a short period of time, and the orthopedic surgery
practice was not an exclusion. Elective care was deferred in most health care facilities and emergency care was continued with strict precautions. With rapid progression of the pandemic, the response of the medical community is also
rapidly changing in all aspects of delivering care. This led to a large number of publications with reports, guidelines,
performed with all related terms on two scientiﬁc search engines, PubMed and SCOPUS, and the results were ﬁltered
5 main headings; the impact of pandemic on the orthopedic practice, COVID-19 and the trauma patient, elective and
emergency surgeries during the pandemic, peri-operative management of the patient with COVID-19, Miscellaneous
Key words: COVID-19, Orthopaedics.
COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a potential infectious threat in China in December 2019, [1–3] and
declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on
March 11, 2020 [4]. With the massive burden on health systems
around the world, COVID-19 has heavily impacted all aspects
of the medical practice including specialities that are not
directly related to its clinical effects such as orthopedic surgery.
Elective surgical procedures have been postponed in order to
reduce the burden on health systems and allow for more availability of hospital beds for the more needy. Management of
emergent and urgent surgical cases has also been affected [5].
A continuous need is present to address the daily new information and to employ them in our orthopedic practices. Moreover,
with more countries reaching their peak and plateau phase,
healthcare facilities are getting ready to reopen and resume
medical care. This will require a solid understanding of the
precautions required for this resumption during such a critical
phase, which may extend for a few months ahead, not to
mention some speculations of a second wave of COVID-19
guidelines relevant to the orthopedic community available in
the literature to help us plan for the current phase and those
yet to come.
To provide the most relevant and up to date information for
the orthopedic community, a systematic approach was used to
gather information. A literature search was conducted on May
22nd on Medline and SCOPUS with the terms “COVID-19”,
“COVID 19”, “COVID”, “Corona virus” or “Corona”, together
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method and ﬂowchart were

reduced the number to 262 after exclusion of non-English
information. Relevant information was digested and organized
under 5 main headings; the impact of COVID-19 pandemic
on the orthopedic practice, COVID-19 and the trauma patient,
elective and emergency surgeries during the pandemic, perioperative management of the patient with COVID-19,
Miscellaneous effects of the pandemic such as those on training
programs and the evolution of telemedicine.
The impact of COVID-19 pandemic
Lack of sufﬁcient evidence and the highly contagious nature
of COVID-19 led to drastic measures implemented by many
countries varying from social distancing to total lockdown,
which had tremendous global economic and social effects
[7, 8]. The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented
challenge to healthcare systems mainly due to the exponential
expansion of the patient population in need of hospitalization
surpassing available resources [9–14]. With the risks posed by
shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [13–15]
non-traditional solutions were developed such as 3D printed face
shields, reusable gowns, and protocols for the re-use of PPE
[18]. Moreover, the sudden overload of healthcare systems mandated institution of new hospitals as well as changing the bed
capacity to increase respiratory care beds; this was coupled with
initial reduction and later cancelation of all elective procedures
in order to save the available resources and limit spread of the
virus [19–27]. In the midst of this crisis, the orthopedic surgeon
was surely affected: from de-specialization and serving on the
frontline, to upgrades from fellow to faculty and reassignment
of residents to clinical care rotations [18–28]. Managing
COVID-19 patients with surgical emergencies and trauma with
the risk of self-infection have led to a higher degree of anxiety
M.K. Abdelnasser et al.: SICOT-J 2020, 6, 24
to provide meetings for faculty, quick and wide spread of
knowledge, and outreach to patients through telehealth systems
COVID-19 and the trauma patient
So far, very few studies reported the association between
COVID-19 and trauma patients [33–35]. Given the fact that
patients with fractures especially of the lower extremity and
those with limited ambulatory capacity are more susceptible
to respiratory infection [36], the association between
COVID-19 and trauma patients is not unlikely.
Mi et al. reported on 10 trauma patients with COVID-19,
seven of them (70%) had a nosocomial infection after
admission to the hospital because of their fracture [34].
Although SARS-CoV-2 was positive in only 6 patients, the
characteristic CT ground-glass opacities were evident in all
patients. Clinical symptoms were not different from those present in patients without factures. Lymphopenia was more common in patients with fractures. Moreover, D-Dimer and the
median neutrophilic count were higher than the upper normal
limits of the corresponding indicators. These might be special
laboratory indicators of fractures in patients with COVID-19.
Four patients (40%) died and three others (30%) developed
between COVID-19 pneumonia and fractures can lead to severe
adverse outcomes and increased mortality [34].
Catellani et al. reported on 16 patients of proximal femoral
fractures positive for COVID-19 [35]. All patients presented
with fever and oxygen desaturation on ambient air; 14 of them
required respiratory support. Improved respiratory parameters
were evident in 12 out of 13 patients who underwent early
may contribute to the overall patient stability, improvement in
physiological ventilation, seated mobilization, and general
patient comfort in bed [35].
Nevertheless, the association between COVID-19 characteristic CT picture and trauma patients has also been reported
in absence of symptoms related to COVID-19 pneumonia [33].
Emergent, urgent, and elective procedures
The necessity to choose which operations to proceed with
and which can wait is a challenging and sometimes difﬁcult
decision during the pandemic crisis. In the light of the available
questions to our practice.
A. What is the definition of an elective procedure?
In the time of the pandemic, it is important to identify
elective procedures or in other terms, the ones that could be
delayed. Although this may sound simple, the pandemic itself
has made such a sharp distinction impossible, creating a large
gray zone. This question is particularly relevant to the orthopedic practice as 47% of the expenditure is from elective surgeries
[37]. With no consensus reached in the orthopedic community,
to each facility according to its resources and to each patient
according to the condition [37–39].
The Ohio Hospital Association (OHA) deﬁned elective
surgeries as those not meeting the following criteria “threat to
the patient’s life if surgery or procedure is not performed, threat
of permanent dysfunction of an extremity or an organ system,
risk of metastasis or progression of staging, or risk of rapidly
diseases (low or moderate risk of clinical deterioration) can
short-term clinical deterioration) should be considered for surgery with precautions [40].
The COVID-19 status of the patient whether positive, negative, or not tested is another important factor that affects the
time of surgical intervention [40].
B. Why postpone elective procedures?
Reducing surgeries saves resources including hospital beds,
PPEs, as well as protecting the surgical staff [5]. This can also
diminish the risk of perioperative complications and mortality,
[40, 41] reduce unnecessary patient trafﬁc and decrease the
introduction and spread of disease among patients and health
care providers [5].
C. What should be offered to patients as an alternative
to surgical intervention?
Delays of operative intervention in elective cases although
temporary, might extend for months as a best estimate. Patients
should be offered sound alternatives to assist them bear the
anticipated waiting times, this could be in the form of optimized
medical treatment, individualized non-surgical options through
psychological support, and in pediatric patients engaging families and stressing on safety measures [40–42].
D. Are there any recommendations on categorizing
and managing orthopedic conditions?
according to urgency, [37, 38] as well as guidelines put forth
by international societies [45–47].
Awad et al. stratiﬁed orthopedic conditions into ﬁve categories according to urgency, A through E, A being the most
urgent [45]. Open fractures, acute neurovascular derangements
as well as acute infections were rendered as emergent (A) to be
operated within 24 h. Closed fractures were grouped under B or
C. Deformities, arthroplasty and trigger ﬁnger were grouped
Farrell et al. suggested some management plans for
the pediatric orthopedic patient [42]. In the pediatric trauma
patient, modiﬁcations to standard care were mostly to the

Excellent results can be still obtained
with a period of delay
during the COVID-19 era [48]. Patients were classiﬁed into
three levels according to the urgency of surgical intervention
and the facility in which the patient should be operated upon.
E. How to triage patients during the COVID-19 pandemic?
Awad et al. recommended regional organization by assigning designated hospitals with orthopedic staff to treat only suspected or conﬁrmed COVID-19 patients and other hospitals in
the same regions to treat exclusively non-infected patients [45].
This may not be feasible in some regions or districts and in such
a case, the same hospital should be divided into areas or wards
according to the risk of exposure to the virus, with a stratiﬁed
On the personnel level, all should apply the general selfprotection rules like, safe distancing, face masks, goggles for
eye protection, hand disinfection, regular decontamination of
all patient/staff contact points, and avoidance of touching one’s
working in the hospital involved in direct patient care, while
the other teams are away from the hospital through 14 days
as a “quarantine” between episodes of direct patient care [51].
This requires adequate number of medical staff which has not
always been the case in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ponsetti casting can be commenced later
Consider teleconferencing
Follow-up after the pandemic.
Offer prehab program.
On the patient level, in hospitals still running outpatient
clinics, patients should be screened for symptoms like (fever,
cough, sore throat), if the patient shows positive symptoms
consider delaying the outpatient management till test results
are available. If a patient’s operation could not be delayed for
testing, then the patient should be re-triaged into the emergency
category and presumed COVID positive. All of this should be
done with proper precautions such as wearing face masks,
distancing, and well-aerated waiting areas [52, 53].
As for patients in the Emergency Department (ED) and
crowded triage areas, same protective precautions apply, and
if the patient is oriented, he/she is asked for the suspect criteria
for COVID-19 infection. Suspected or conﬁrmed COVID-19
patients should be isolated in a separate room and should keep
at least 6 feet distance from other patients or non-treating staff.
COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing should
be done for all patients that will be admitted or will undergo
surgery. Surgeons should not approach the triage area without
the minimum standard PPE recommended. PPE should be
exchanged if they are damaged or soiled or before leaving
the ED. Only required equipment and assessment tools should
be brought into the triage room to minimize the number of
items that need to be disinfected after the exposure [45–54].
F. What are the peri-operative precautions when operating
on a COVID-19 positive or suspected case?
This should be incorporated into hospital plans and rules to
face the pandemic, [55] and can be subdivided into measures

involving the operating room, personnel, anesthesia, the procedure, and postoperative precautions.
Operating room measures
Separate operating rooms (OR) should be designated for
COVID-19 positive patients, isolated from other operating rooms
[5–45]. The operating room is preferred to have a separate
ventilation system with negative pressure [5, 58–60], which if
not available, it is recommended to add High-Efﬁciency
Particulate Air (HEPA) ﬁlters to positive pressure rooms
[51–54]. Moreover, Air conditioning should be turned off
Only the materials necessary for the case should be brought
into the OR [5]. All equipment and screens should be covered
with plastic sheets to facilitate decontamination [45]. Consider
attenuation of residual environmental contamination through
cleaning with surface disinfectants and ultraviolet light
All trafﬁc in and out of the OR should be minimized
[5–54]. All doors should be closed once the patient is transferred in and during the whole operation [5]. The path of the
patient to and from the OR should be kept clear and better to
be separate from other operating rooms [5]. Patients should
cover their face with a surgical mask [5]. The patient should
recover in the operating room and transferred directly to the
isolation ward [5–62].
The number of personnel inside the OR should be kept to
the minimum. Services personnel should not enter the room
M.K. Abdelnasser et al.: SICOT-J 2020, 6, 24
until enough time has elapsed for air changers to reduce the risk
of contamination [45–61]. Sales representatives, residents, and
fellows should be discarded from OR unless essential [5–51].
inspection or destruction [5, 45–61]. All contaminated instruments and devices should be disinfected separately followed
by proper labeling [5, 45–61].
Operating personnel
Postoperative precautions
The fewest number of personnel possible is the main goal,
with the highest skilled surgeon performing the procedure to
avoid prolongation of the surgery [51, 54, 59, 64]. All personnel
in the operating room should wear the PPE which include Association of Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)
level III surgical gowns, surgical hood (for head and neck covering), double gloves, facemasks and either N95, Filtering Face
Piece 2 (FFP2) respirators with a face shield/googles or Powered
Air-Purifying Respirator (PARP), ﬂuid-resistant shoes or
booties [5, 49–57]. Donning and dofﬁng of PPE should be done
in an anteroom if available, [5–56] with hand hygiene prior and
after donning/dofﬁng PPE [5]. Avoid self-contamination during
PPE dofﬁng. Disinfect the ﬁrst pair of gloves with an alcohol
solution, before removing the surgical mask with the shield
and the hair cap [5–56]. Consider placing a simple surgical mask
on top of the N-95 to prevent gross contamination. Each time
N95 respirator is taken off, it must be double-checked for not
being soiled or damaged before reuse [5, 45–57]. Full face shield
is preferred to protective eye goggles [5, 52–57].
Dedicated anesthesia machines should be exclusively designated for COVID-19 positive cases [62]. The most experienced
anesthesiologist should intubate the patient in the shortest
possible time with minimal airway manipulation, avoiding
face mask ventilation and open-air way suction as possible
[5, 45–60]. Keep the minimum number of personnel inside
the anesthesia room which should be separate from the operating room, which should not be entered for 15–20 min after
intubation [5, 51–57].
Use deep anesthesia and neuromuscular blockage. Preoxygenation should be performed via well-ﬁtting face mask
to avoid hypoxia in critically ill COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure [60–65]. It is preferred to avoid general anesthesia
and use of regional/spinal anesthesia is recommended whenever
possible [60].
Surgical procedure
Consider the use of minimally invasive approaches to
decrease operating staff exposure and shorten case duration
[5, 51–66]. Use disposable medical supplies/instruments whenever possible, and absorbable sutures for wound closure to
avoid a postoperative unnecessary visit [45–51]. The use of
electrocautery should be reduced to minimize the surgical
smoke and should be used in conjunction with a smoke evacuator [5, 58, 59, 67]. Care should be taken when using sharp
objects to avoid sharp injury or damage of PPE [61]. The use
of power tools like bone saws, reamers, and drills should be
reduced to the minimum and the power settings should be as
low as possible, as they release aerosols, increasing the risk
of virus spread. Suction devices to remove smoke and aerosols
should be used during their use [68].
All body ﬂuids as blood, secretions, urine, or pathological specimens should be collected in double sealed bags for
The transfer to isolation wards should be through dedicated
corridors and elevators which should be carefully sterilized after
transport [55, –62]. During the transfer, transport personnel
should wear PPE which should not be the same as worn during
the procedure and patients should be wearing N-95/FFP2 masks
and covered with disposable operating sheets [5, 58–62].
Surgeons must be aware of common postoperative complications from COVID-19 infections. In the presence of fever and
one of the symptoms of a respiratory infection (dry cough, etc.),
laboratory tests for COVID-19 diagnosis must be ordered.
Suspected cases should be reported immediately together with
transfer of the patient to an isolation ward [69]. Patients should
receive adequate nutrition, ﬂuid hydration, and electrolyte
balance to promote immune recovery and rapid rehabilitation
[61]. Frequent monitoring of temperature, laboratory Complete
Blood Count (CBC), C-reactive protein, and Ferritin level
should be done [70]. Severe COVID-19 infection might cause
a “cytokine storm syndrome”, which is characterized by a
fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia with multiorgan failure.
An increased level of ferritin occurs in approximately 50% of
patients. All patients with severe COVID-19 should be screened
for hyper-inﬂammation markers [71].
Safe and effective patient care during the pandemic
and telemedicine
In order to resume safe patient care, telemedicine has been
widely used during this pandemic [72–75]. Telemedicine
allows health care providers to deliver clinical services to
patients through the use of the widely available telecommunication technologies. It can be used for patient triage, postoperative
educational programs or videoconferences. Moreover, rehabilitation can be tele-monitored through special technologies such
as wireless sensors for range of motion such as the knee following knee arthroplasty. Nonetheless, telemedicine has its limitations. Patients with sutures to remove, cast to change or need
comprehensive clinical examination will still have to pay an
in person visit to the health care facility. Also, there are obstacles for wide implementation of such services such as infrastructure cost, provider and patient education, data protection,
ethical consideration, legalization, and payment regulation [64].
In order to facilitate the use of telemedicine, the Ofﬁce for
Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Zoom, and FaceTime without imposing penalties for noncompliance. In all cases, documentation within the patient medical
record is mandatory [76].
Training during the pandemic
The COVID-19 crisis called for alternative methods to
resume resident and fellow education [77–79], an example is
M.K. Abdelnasser et al.: SICOT-J 2020, 6, 24
the ﬂipped virtual classroom method, in which the learners are
meeting focused on active learning and case-based discussions.
webinars, and telehealth clinics with resident involvement.
Many applications such as Webex, Google Classroom,
conferences. The main drawback to this approach is that it cannot involve actual clinical or surgical skills teaching. Others
include difﬁculties some senior staff may have with utilizing
modern technology, slow internet speed in some regions, and
difﬁculties with viewing some pictures especially radiology
[80]. To overcome these obstacles high-deﬁnition 3D operative
videos and surgical simulations are being employed. Various
simulation modalities are available including surgical skills
laboratories, cadaveric dissections and procedural training,
and computer-based virtual reality training [81–84].
The 2020 Annual Meeting of American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) is now being made available
through the AAOS website. This includes instructional course
lectures, and ask expert sessions, in addition to the traditional
research paper and poster presentations. The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) has developed the
for resident and fellow training through recording attendance
Making use of the crisis and planning for the
post-pandemic era
Global cooperation and exchange of experiences are still to
be improved. The pandemic is still in various stages in different
countries. Countries with increasing numbers of cases and
mortalities are learning from those recovering from the crisis.
The future requires better planning and re-allocation of
resources to be prepared for such events.
To make use of the available technologies in telemedicine is
of utmost importance. Remote triaging and examination techniques, feedback through mobile applications, and virtual interdisciplinary meetings should be encouraged. Urgent legislative
reforms to adapt to these changes are mandatory.
E-learning, virtual conferences, webinars, and simulation
training initiatives must be supported by the international
scientiﬁc societies. Curricula should be revised to adapt to these
needs. Non-technical skills should constitute integral part of
learning programs.
Plans should be prepared to manage the accumulated long
waiting lists of elective surgeries [85–89]. Prioritization should
be rational without inferring excessive burden on the recovering
health system after the crisis.
including orthopedic surgery will differ after the pandemic is
over. Implementation of new technologies, restructuring our
health systems with incorporation of telemedicine as well as
reorganizing of our traditional training programs will be crucial
for a more effective and optimal delivery of care.
