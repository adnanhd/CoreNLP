Background: Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, public health interventions have been introduced globally in order to
prevent the spread of the virus and avoid the overload of health care systems, especially for the most severely affected
patients. Scientific studies to date have focused primarily on describing the clinical course of patients, identifying
treatment options and developing vaccines. In Germany, as in many other regions, current tests for SARS-CoV2 are not
conducted on a representative basis and in a longitudinal design. Furthermore, knowledge about the immune status of
the population is lacking. Nonetheless, these data are needed to understand the dynamics of the pandemic and hence to
appropriately design and evaluate interventions. For this purpose, we recently started a prospective population-based
cohort in Munich, Germany, with the aim to develop a better understanding of the state and dynamics of the pandemic.
Methods: In 100 out of 755 randomly selected constituencies, 3000 Munich households are identified via random route
and offered enrollment into the study. All household members are asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and
subjects ‚â•14 years of age are asked to provide a venous blood sample of ‚â§3 ml for the determination of SARS-CoV-2
IgG/IgA status. The residual plasma and the blood pellet are preserved for later genetic and molecular biological
investigations. For twelve months, each household member is asked to keep a diary of daily symptoms, whereabouts and
contacts via WebApp. If symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 are reported, family members, including children < 14 years,
Munich, for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2. In case of severe symptoms, participants will be transferred to a Munich
hospital. For one year, the study teams re-visits the households for blood sampling every six weeks.

Discussion: With the planned study we will establish a reliable epidemiological tool to improve the understanding of the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to better assess the effectiveness of public health measures as well as their socio-economic
effects. This will support policy makers in managing the epidemic based on scientific evidence.

Since the first description of the novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the disease has spread worldwide and classified as a global emergency by the WHO in early 2020 [1]. In Germany, the
first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered on January 6th 2020 at the Division of Infectious Diseases and
3]. The transmission chains were interrupted by contact
tracing and isolation of the affected persons. However,
due to the return of German tourists from holidays in the
high-risk areas of northern Italy, in connection with a carnival celebration in the district of Heinsberg (60 km west
of Cologne), the virus spread to 13 of 16 federal states
within one month [4]. The exponential increase in newly
confirmed cases in Germany reached a total of 155.193
positively tested cases on April 27th 2020 (187 per 100,
000 inhabitants) [4].
Simulations and experiences of other countries suggest
that healthcare systems would be overburdened and
eventually collapse due to a pronounced increase of patients needing intensive care support if no interventions
were implemented [5‚Äì13]. In the absence of vaccinations
and specific treatment options, public health interventions were initiated in Germany, similarly to numerous
other countries comparably affected. The measures include isolation of confirmed patients, quarantine of their
contacts, use of personal protective equipment, social
borders [6, 14]. Prediction models and experiences from
countries like South Korea suggest that combination of
these measures could be effective in combatting the disease [13, 15‚Äì18]. However, past evidence from other epidemics was not that convincing with respect to
controlling virus spread by social distancing [19]. It remains unclear how comparable previous viral diseases
outbreaks are to SARS-CoV-2 [20]. While potentially
saving lives and protecting healthcare systems from
breakdown, one has to bear in mind that measures of social distancing can have a devastating impact on national
and global economies, healthcare systems, incomes of
individuals and families (especially those in precarious
employment conditions), education (which particularly
affects disadvantaged groups) and on health and the psychosocial well-being of populations [20‚Äì22]. Devastating
effects seen in high-income societies will likely be much
worse in low and middle income countries [23].
Results of simulation studies existing so far differ considerably. This is partly due to the unknown number of
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
carriers, and thus the number of undetected cases [4, 7,
13, 17, 24, 25]. In addition, the number of confirmed
cases depends on access to healthcare, laboratory availability, and on the criteria applied to select the individuals who should be tested. Therefore, the basic and the
effective reproduction number can only be very roughly
estimated and the hospitalization and mortality rates remain to be confirmed. Community cohorts can help to
assess the overall spread of infection in the targeted
population and thus provide more reliable estimates of
the basic and the effective reproduction number. This
will help to evaluate the burden on the healthcare system as well as the effectiveness of public health interventions [26].
Aim of KoCo19 (prospective Covid-19 cohort Munich)
With the community-based household study presented
in this paper, we aim to study the sero-prevalence and
-incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a representative
household sample of the Munich population. With this
approach we will provide a constantly updated epidemiological instrument that represents the number of
infections that have occurred in the city. The study may
also serve as a pilot for studies in other areas of
Germany and other countries.
The following study questions will be addressed:
1) Baseline visit
 What is the SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence in the
Munich general population?
 How many of the initially seropositive individuals in
the baseline-study were previously tested by
pharyngeal swab and nucleic acid amplification
(PCR) (positively or negatively) and/or had symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 (yes or no)?
Radon et al. BMC Public Health
 What is the distribution of symptom severity in each

of the groups described above?
 How high is the risk of infection for other
household members if one person is infected and
can household risk factors be identified?
 How high is the risk of infection for other
inhabitants of the same apartment building if one
person is infected?
 What are the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2
The study design of KoCo19 is a community-based prospective cohort study in randomly selected Munich
households. All members of the selected households
who are eligible and agree to participate (see ‚ÄúStudy
population‚Äù) are invited to the following parts of the
2) Follow-up visits
 Is there a change in antibody titers of those who
initially tested positive, which is potentially
necessary to discriminate from cross-reactivity with
other corona viruses?
How does the spread of the disease develop and
what influence do public health measures have on
the incidence?
What is the impact of individual behaviour on the
incidence of infection?
Which risk factors are associated with SARS-CoV-2
What is the socio-economic impact of the pandemic
and the measures to combat it, especially on the employment situation and psychosocial endpoints?
Setting of KoCo19
Munich, the capital of the Free State of Bavaria, is located in the southeast of Germany. Approximately 1.5
million people live here, 9% of these are 75 years and
older [27]. The population density is 50 inhabitants per
ha [27]. There are 70 hospital beds (including 5 intensive
care unit beds) and 13 doctors for every 10,000 inhabitants [27]. After the first 100 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were
reported in Munich by March 12th 2020, the Bavarian
2020, initially until May 11 th 2020. Since the same date,
all shops that do not sell the basic needs of the population were closed. Starting on March 21th 2020, when
1288 infected individuals were reported in Munich, curfews were implemented [28]. According to these curfews, people are essentially only allowed to leave the
house to go to work, to the doctor, to buy food, for outdoor sport related activities (jogging, walking) or to help
others who are depending on support. A minimum distance of 1.5 m between individuals must be maintained.
1. Baseline study (1st household visit): During the
baseline study, personal identifying information is
collected and stored in a database separately from
the remaining questionnaire information. A blood
sample is taken from which sero-prevalences of
SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies are
After the household visit, participants are asked to
answer an:
2. Daily diary: Using a web-based app, participants are
asked to fill out a daily diary on symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection, whereabouts, and social
contacts. Additional questions might be included
throughout the follow-up period. If symptoms of
COVID-19 occur, a pharyngeal swab for PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 is offered at our division.
3. Follow-up household visits: Households are revisited every three to six weeks for a new blood
sample in order to estimate the sero-incidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. This frequency can be
adapted to the current necessities of estimated prediction models. The follow-ups are currently
planned for up to 12 months.
The study will be terminated if more efficient methods
to assess the course of the epidemic are developed or if
this no longer appears relevant.
KoCo19 study population
For KoCo19, a representative sample of Munich households (target population) is selected by random walk
door-to-door methodology [29]. For this purpose, 100 of
the 755 Munich constituencies were randomly selected
using R (The R project). In each of these constituencies,
the geographic center is selected as the starting point of
the random route using QGIS. From the address closest
to this starting point, 30 households per constituency
will be included in the study according to a fixed algorithm. In the case of apartment buildings, one household
per floor is selected to investigate possible transmission
within the building.
All household members ‚â•14 years are invited to participate in KoCo19 by donating a maximum of 3 ml of
blood and to be available for further blood tests every

three to six weeks. Participants are informed about their
SARS-CoV-2 antibody status. Additionally, all household
members are asked to complete a daily questionnaire on
their state of health, whereabouts and social contacts
using an internet or a smartphone app (WebApp). Persons who do not have a mobile phone or cannot operate
an App will be interviewed by phone. At least one
household member needs to agree to donate blood,
while other members can solely participate in the
Inclusion criteria are:
 At the time of inclusion in the study (1st household
visit), at least one of the household members must
be ‚â•18 years and competent to provide written

worker is a medical student with prior, extensive training in infectious disease control, including blood sampling and pharyngeal swabs in case participants have
symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 within 14-days
prior to this visit. The second field worker is responsible
for the informed consent and interviews. Teams of field
workers are carefully trained in study procedures, data
confidentiality, and infection protection and undergo a
proficiency test before initiating field work. During the
first field visits, they are accompanied by a senior medical doctor of the Division of Infectious Diseases and
until the physician approves correct handling of all steps
of the field work. To further ensure the quality of field
work randomly selected households are called and asked
about the last study visit and potential problems. In
addition, teams will be repeatedly monitored by a senior
medical doctor throughout the study. To avoid infection
risks through public transport, all teams use rental cars
during the field work. This is also helpful for the teams
to be able to carry all the necessary material including
personal protective and hygiene equipment.

Study instruments: questionnaires
Non-response is recorded and taken into account in
the analysis of the response index. Where feasible, basic
information (age, sex, type of building) and reason of
non-participation are collected for non-responders in
order to assess representativeness of the study population. In addition, participants‚Äô socioeconomic status, migrant status, sex, and percentage of households with
children and single households will be compared to the
official statistics of the selected constituencies and of all
Munich constituencies (Statistical Office Munich).

The household questionnaire includes questions about
the living situation (type of housing, number of bedrooms, apartment size), number of inhabitants (including date of birth and sex), highest level of education,
work situation, household income, second hand smoke
exposure, work of household members in potentially
high risk jobs for SARS-CoV-2 infections, past
pharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 in household
members including test results.
-Individual baseline questionnaire
Radon et al. BMC Public Health
At baseline, all participating household members are
asked about date of birth, sex, level of education, employment situation, smoking history, general health,
pregnancy, recent influenza vaccination, pre-existing
medical conditions, symptoms suggestive for COVID-19
in the 14 days prior to the study, past PCR testing of
nasopharyngeal samples for SARS-CoV-2 including test
result, use of respiratory masks, and work in a potentially high risk job for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Assuming that each person is included in the study with
the same probability, repeated drawing of 4500 from 1.5
million Munich residents will yield the 95% confidence
prevalence of the total of reported and unreported infections in the baseline survey. The prevalence of confirmed cases was 0.3% on April 9th 2020 [34]. This
shows that the sample size is sufficient for an adequately
precise estimate of the actual sero-prevalence in the
baseline survey.
Data management
The daily diary includes items about symptoms suggestive for COVID-19, social contacts, whereabouts and
use of public transport in the past 24 h. Further questions on e.g., the psychosocial and economic situation,
such as perceived health status, behavioral aspects, or
employment and income will be added over the time of
the study, and collected e.g. once a week.
Laboratory analyses
Samples will be analyzed and stored at the Division of
First, blood is sampled in 2.7 ml EDTA containers and
thoroughly mixed. Samples are individually barcoded
and packed to be transported to the laboratory ion ice.
There, the samples are centrifuged to separate the cell
pellet from the remaining plasma. Cell pellets are frozen
at ‚àí 80 ¬∞C for further analysis, while the plasma is used
for ELISA analysis using a semi-automated robotic system (Euroanalyzer I, Euroimmune, L√ºbeck, Germany).
Serology is performed primarily using the Anti-SARSCov-2-ELISA IgG and IgA (Euroimmune, L√ºbeck,
Germany). The ELISA system has a combined sensitivity
of between 66.7% (< 10 days after onset of symptoms)
and 100% (> 10 days after onset of symptoms) according
to the manufacturer. Specificity is rated as 98.5%, tested
in larger cohorts of blood donors. The remaining plasma
is stored for further analysis or confirmatory testing e.g.
with virus neutralization as appropriate.
Pharyngeal swabs are taken using eSwab systems. The
samples are stored at 4 ¬∞C and immediately transported
to the laboratory. There, RNA extraction is performed.
Extracted RNA is divided to allow for cryo-conservation
at ‚àí 80 ¬∞C as well as for diagnostic RT-PCR for SARSCoV-2. The reserve sample will be used for virus sequence analysis to perform cluster and outbreak analysis
and to study within family transmission.

Hospital Munich. The pseudonymized databases will be
combined using a unique participant ID. Using the combined raw data, a scripted routine analysis is used to
produce a daily update of descriptive and bivariate
prevalence and incidence data to generate a study ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù (The R project). Main outcome variables are the
prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as
well as SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in the study population
and the dynamics thereof. Main exposure variables are
socio-economic factors, social contacts, city district as
well as the living situation. In addition, changes in the
non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will be
used as predictor of SARS-CoV-2 incidence.
Descriptive analyses
Initial descriptive data analyses will be weighted for cluster sampling and include the following parameters:
 Description of basic data for responder and non-
responder households
 Socio-demographic data and known risk factors for
SARS-CoV-2 infection
 Baseline prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity
in the Munich general population stratified for a)
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases and b) cases

In addition, the data is used to gain knowledge about
spread dynamics and to predict the further development
of the epidemic under different scenarios. Models used
for this purpose are developed throughout the course of
the study.
The ongoing SARS-CoV-19 pandemic has changed daily
life globally to an extent unseen before. Due to the lack
of vaccinations and pharmacological treatment options,
it was predicted that not taking public health action will
result in an overload of healthcare systems in most
countries and a mortality of millions in the global population [25]. The public health interventions that have
been recently implemented by most countries have a
huge impact on the economy and most likely, also on
health and well-being of the global population. Therefore, to further understand the dynamics of the disease,
population-based representative household studies might
be helpful and needed, in order to reliably estimate the
total number of previously infected individuals (with and
without symptoms), who are ‚Äì hopefully ‚Äì resistant to
infection for an extended period of time.
The study presented here will provide a first estimate
of the prevalence and incidence of sero-positivity in the
Munich population. Although not generalizable on a
global scale, this will give first insights about the proportion of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic carriers of
SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to the number of those
tested. It will also help to identify risk factors for infection, course of disease and effectiveness and efficiency of
the public health measures.
Our study has limitations. In the last years, willingness
to participate in population-based studies went down
considerably [35, 36]. Low response might affect representativeness of the study population, which in turn
might have an effect on the generalizability of the prevalence of positive antibody results to the Munich source
population. However, it is unlikely that participation will
depend on sero-positivity of antibody results as antibody
status is unknown prior to inclusion in the study. In
addition, the research topic is of uppermost interest for
many citizens in the current situation, therefore response is expected to be higher in KoCo19 than in other
studies. During the first recruitment days, an overall response of close to 50% was reached, this provides evidence for the aforementioned hypothesis. Response will
be increased by revisiting households which did not
open the door at the first visit. For the associations
under study, representativeness is of less concern [37].
However, we might not be able to reach high response especially in specific groups of the target population, e.g.
subjects with migration background as they are generally
harder to reach in epidemiological studies [38] and because time constraints impede the development of study
documents in other languages than German at the initiation of the study. Likewise, the spread of SARS-CoV-2
varies locally and depends on several factors, such as the
time course of the infection in the respective region, the
Radon et al. BMC Public Health
population density and age distribution of the population,
the available capacities and the applied countermeasures.
Therefore, prevalence and incidence results obtained in
this study locally might not be easily generalizable to other
cities, regions or countries. Losses-to-follow up will likely
occur especially when public health interventions are reduced or become less restrictive and the public attention
focuses less on the pandemic. However, as long as these
missing data can be assumed to be missing at random
multiple imputation can account for attrition [39].
With respect to reporting bias, one may assume that
participants are more likely to over-report symptoms
which will result in an overestimation of the symptom
prevalence. In order to minimize other forms of reporting bias we use as many items from validated questionnaire instruments as possible. In addition, all items were
carefully checked by several members of the KoCo-19
team for their face validity. Questionnaires, especially
the daily diary, were kept as short as possible. Therefore,
the study might not be able to answer specific questions
in favour of more valid answers and low attrition rate
over time. For such aspects, case-control studies, potentially nested in the current study, could be performed.
For ethical reasons, participants will receive their SARSCoV-2 antibody status after each blood sampling. This
might influence their subsequent behaviour, especially
when antibody status is positive.
To minimize social desirability bias, questionnaires are
web-based and are completed by the participants themselves. However, because not all participants might have
web-access and especially older participants might not
have the necessary internet competencies, a telephone
interview) is recorded so that systematic differences in
response can be accounted for. We are not able to include children under the age of 14 years from the beginning mainly due to ethical concerns regarding the
venous blood sampling by a medical student. Over the
course of the study development of other test methods
might allow the inclusion of this important part of the
Random route recruitment is a feasible way of recruitment where population lists do not exist or are hard to
obtain. It has been applied by the WHO in various vaccination studies since the 1980s, was modified over time
and it is also used in large scale community surveys such
as the European Working Condition Survey [29, 40].
The alternative approach, sampling via the Munich
population registry, would have taken more time due to
the formal requirements and thus would have slowed
down the start of the study. As we apply a cluster sampling approach (100 out of 755 constituencies) and include more than one person per household and more
than one subject per apartment building, clustering has
to be taken into account in the statistical analyses. Using
constituencies made inclusion of 3000 households and
the follow-up visits within six weeks feasible. Inclusion
of more than one household member and one household
per floor will help us to better understand the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 within households and apartment buildings. In addition, inclusion of more than one household
per apartment building takes into account that larger
number of inhabitants live in apartment buildings, than
in one- or two-family houses, which would otherwise
have been overrepresented.
The sample size calculation reported here did not take
clustering into account. This was due to the fact that the
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 within clusters (household,
apartment building, constituency) is so far unknown.
Taking a more conservative approach of considering
only 3000 participants (= number of households) instead
of 4500 participants, the 95% Confidence Interval for a
given prevalence of 0.5% (50%) would increase from
0.3‚Äì0.7% (49‚Äì51%) to 0.3‚Äì0.8% (48‚Äì52%). Thus,
changes are minimal and we therefore conclude that our
prevalence estimates will be precise.
Currently, there is only a limited number of reliable
serologic tests available. By using the ‚Äì to our knowledge ‚Äì best currently available serology test system with
IVD certification in the study, the number of valid results will be maximized as compared to other less mature testing systems. Still, with very low sero-prevalence,
the false positive rates in the population might be in the
range of the test-background. All currently performed
studies face this limitation. However, by repeating visits,
the seroconversions will be confirmed, thus offering
much better data than mere sero-prevalence data. In
addition, it has not yet been established that seropositivity in ELISA reliably corresponds to immunity.
Thus further testing such as virus neutralization is performed for questionable cases.
As serology only allows the detection of infection in
retrospect, the pharyngeal swab is essential to pick up
acute infections. This also allows to detect subjects with
symptomatic disease who possibly never develop positive
serology; although it is currently believed that most patients will develop positive serology within 10 days after
onset of symptoms. Besides, the swab can be used to extract viral RNA and used for sequencing, offering further
information about transmission dynamics within households, quarters or even worldwide.
In a pandemic situation, it would neither be ethical
nor feasible to use medical doctors for epidemiological
field work as they are needed for clinical service. Therefore, experienced medical students together with students of other subjects perform the field work of this
study. The medical students involved are not removed
from other important tasks during the pandemic. Ethical

related to SARS-CoV-2; it will provide an important epidemiological basis for our understanding of the epidemic, and might serve as a blueprint for similar studies.

2020, number 20‚Äì275). Written informed consent is sought from all participants. In case of minors between the ages of 8 and 17 years, participants
and their legal guardian(s) are asked for written informed consent. For children below the age of 8 years, written informed consent is sought from the
legal guardian(s). The pseudonymization of the data enables us to provide
the participants with individualized results. Personal identifying information is
stored in a password-protected database containing only contact details,
contact status and contact IDs. The data for each questionnaire response
and the other samples are stored in a separate password-protected database
containing only ID numbers. It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions about the identity of the participants and the information they have
provided. Compliance with data protection regulations was approved by the
Gerhard Meyer. The data are stored for as long as they are needed to
achieve the study objectives. Ten years after the start of the study (and every
three years thereafter), the study team will evaluate whether the study objectives for the project have been achieved and, if so, will request the deletion
of all personal data.
