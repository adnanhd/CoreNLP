Background Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been promoted as a potential treatment for
COVID-19 but there are safety concerns.
Objectives To determine the effect of HCQ treatment on QT interval
Methods We retrospectively studied the electrocardiograms of 819 patients treated with HCQ
for rheumatologic diseases from 2000 to 2020. The primary outcome was corrected QT (QTc)
interval, by Bazett formula, during HCQ therapy.
Results The patients were 64.0 (±10.9) years in age and 734 (90%) were men. The median
dosage and duration of HCQ were 400mg daily and 1006 (471-2075) days, respectively. The
mean on-treatment QTc was 430.9 (±31.8) msec. In total, 55 (7%) patients had QTc 470-500
msec and 12 (1.5%) had QTc >500msec. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of atrial
fibrillation (AF) and heart failure were independent risk factors for prolonged QTc. In a subset of
591 patients who also had a pre-treatment ECG, the mean QTc increased from 424.4 (±29.7)
msec. to 432.0 (±32.3) msec (p<0.0001) during HCQ treatment. Of these, 23 (3.9%) patients
had either prolongation of QTc >15% or an on-treatment QTc >500 msec. Over 5.97 (3.3310.11) years of follow-up, 269 (33%) patients died. QTc >470 msec during HCQ treatment was
associated with a greater mortality risk of (hazard ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.71;
p=0.008) in univariable but not in multivariable analysis.
Conclusion Hydroxychloroquine is associated with QT prolongation in a significant fraction of
patients. The risk of QT prolongation is higher among patients with CKD, AF and heart failure,
who may benefit from greater scrutiny.

Since December 2019, the novel single-stranded RNA virus known as the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused millions of cases of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a global pandemic, leading to substantial morbidity and
mortality1. Clinical trajectories of COVID-19 vary widely, with worse outcomes observed in older
individuals and those with concomitant medical conditions2. A significant proportion of
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have cardiovascular disease. Moreover, COVID-19 has
been purported to cause several types of cardiac adverse events, including myocardial injury,
acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, myocarditis, and arrhythmias3–5.There is no
approved treatment for COVID-19, although several strategies are under investigation, such as
antivirals, antiretrovirals, immune modulators and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
Originally used to treat malaria, HCQ was approved for the treatment of systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) by the FDA in 19556. It is currently the most commonly prescribed
medication for SLE and is frequently used for a variety of other rheumatologic conditions.
Cardiac toxicity is rare but there are reports of conduction abnormalities including bundle-branch
block, atrioventricular block, QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death7–10.
There is in vitro evidence that chloroquine and HCQ possess antiviral properties11. These data
have been extrapolated to hypothesize that HCQ may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and
attenuate the course and severity of the COVID-19 disease12. Indeed, on March 28, 2020 the
phosphate) in certain hospitalized patients being treated for COVID-1913. However, recent
studies showing no benefit of HCQ in COVID-19 have since led the FDA to remove that
treated with HCQ describe significant QT prolongation and torsade de pointes which has
expanded clinical concern regarding the arrhythmogenic risk of HCQ18–21. The purpose of this
study is to provide information about the effects of HCQ on cardiac conduction abnormalities
that appear on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).
Informed consent requirement was waived.
Patient Selection
We identified 2665 patients who received at least one prescription for HCQ dispensed at
the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System from the year 2000 to 2020. Each
prescription represented the first dispense of HCQ until a break in prescriptions for at least 150
days22,23. We excluded patients without an ECG performed while they were receiving HCQ
treatment (n=1722). After also excluding the 124 duplicate entries, we included 819 unique
patients who received treatment in this analysis.
All ECGs were performed with the General Electric MAC 5000 and stored in the
Marquette Universal System for Electrocardiography database24,25. We selected the first ECG,
performed at least 5 days after starting the HCQ treatment for analysis. When present, we also
analyzed the last ECG performed before starting the HCQ treatment. We recorded the
ventricular rate, QRS duration, QT interval and the corrected QT interval (QTc) calculated via
the Bazett, Framingham and Friderica formulas. For patients with a QRS >120 msec we used
the Bogossian formula26 to calculate a modified QT interval (QTm), QTm= QT(measured) –
48.5%*QRS(measured). The QTm was used to calculate the QTc. We manually measured the
QT interval, starting from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave on ECG, using
electronic calipers in 70 (8.5%) randomly selected patients in the cohort27. The correlation
coefficient was 0.8.
The primary outcome variable was the QTc interval during HCQ therapy. We used the
Bazett formula for QT correction because it is the most commonly used method to calculate
QTc. QTc > 470 msec represents the 99th percentile of QTc distribution in the general
population and is a predictor of symptoms in patients with long-QT syndrome28,29. QTc > 500
msec is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening arrhythmias29. In a subgroup of patients
who had ECGs before and during HCQ treatment, we also assessed the change in QTc30.
Secondary outcome variable was time to death or last follow-up from the starting date of the
HCQ treatment, as recorded in the VA vital status files24,25,31.
Predictor variables and definitions
We extracted patient demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data from the VA
corporate data warehouse using Structured Query Language. The VA corporate data
warehouse contains extracts from VA clinical and administrative system that includes complete
and other medications were also extracted from the VHA CDW22. The ECG data were obtained
from the Marquette Universal System for Electrocardiography database24,25. Chronic kidney
disease (CKD) was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min. The
eGFR was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault Equation ([140-age] × weight in kg)/(serum
creatinine × 72; multiplied by 0.85 in women).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for continuous
variables, and number (n) and percentage (%) for categorical variables. Comparisons of
characteristics among patients with vs. without QTc prolongation were made with chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and unpaired t test for continuous variables.
The ECG characteristics before vs. during HCQ therapy were compared using paired t-test.
Independent predictors of prolonged QTc were identified by multivariable logistic regression
analysis. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier method and the differences
of survival among patients with vs. without prolonged QTc was examined by the log-rank test.
Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to assess the association between QTc
prolongation and mortality, and to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI). Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS (version 25; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY,
Patient characteristics
64.0 (±10.9) years and 734 (90%) of the patients were male. Cardiovascular comorbidities
included hypertension (n=532, 65%), coronary artery disease (n=234, 29%), diabetes (n=202,
25%) and heart failure (n=65, 8%). A total of 99 (12%) patients had chronic kidney disease
Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed to treat systemic lupus erhythematosus in 786
(96%) of the patients at a median starting dosage of 400 mg daily. The median (25th-75th
percentile) duration of HCQ therapy was 1006 (471-2075) days.
ECG characteristics during HCQ treatment
A 12-lead ECG was performed 234 (92-586) days after starting HCQ therapy in all study
rate was 74.8 (±17.3)beats/min. The mean on-treatment QTc, based on Bazett formula, was
430.9 (±31.8) msec. A total of 55 (7%) patients had on-treatment QTc 470-500 msec. and 12
prolonged QTc were older and more likely to have CKD, history of atrial fibrillation and history of
predictors of QTc >470 msec. Notably, the odds of QTc prolongation was >5 times higher (OR
5.1; 95% CI 1.23-21.1; p=0.025) when eGFR was < 30 ml/min. There was a negative correlation
Paired ECG before and during HCQ treatment
A total of 591 (72%) patients had ECGs performed before (median 345 [98-833] days)
and after (median 204 [84-489] days) starting the HCQ treatment. On these paired ECGs, there
was a modest prolongation of QTc from 424.4 (±29.7) msec. to 432.0 (±32.3) msec. (p<0.0001)
QTc or a QTc > 500 msec with HCQ treatment. These patients were more likely to have chronic
kidney disease (44% vs. 14%; p=0.0001) than the rest of the cohort with paired ECGs.
Survival in relation to QTc
Of the 819 patients in the whole study cohort, 269 (33%) died over a median 5.97 (3.3310.11) years of follow up. In comparison to those who survived, the patients who died were
older, more likely to be men and more likely to have coronary disease, heart failure and CKD. In
univariable Cox regression analysis, QTc > 470 msec. during HCQ therapy was associated with
adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities QTc > 470 msec. during HCQ treatment was no
longer associated with long-term mortality. In patients with paired ECG, delta QTc was not
associated with mortality (HR 1.001, 95% CI 0.998-1.005; p=0.51).
This investigation showed that a significant fraction (8.3%) of the patients prescribed HCQ for
the treatment of SLE had QTc > 470 msec on ECG, including 1.5% who had QTc > 500 msec.
Chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure were associated with QTc
prolongation. Among patients with ECGs performed both before and during treatment, HCQ had
a modest effect on QTc (mean increase 8 msec) except in 3.4% of the patients who had > 15%
increase in QTc. The QTc interval during HCQ treatment was associated with long-term survival
in univariable analysis, while the change in QTc was not.
Hydroxychloroquine blocks the KCNH2-encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel and
can contribute to prolongation of the QTc interval12. Mutations involving these potassium
channels cause the long QT syndrome and their blockage by certain drugs can be associated
with QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden death. While QT prolongation and
postings on the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System7,8,10. A retrospective study of 112
patients with SLE treated with HCQ reported that cardiac conduction abnormalities were present
in 18% of the subjects. These included incomplete bundle branch blocks and second and third
degree atrioventricular blocks. The presence of conduction abnormalities were not associated
with mortality during the first 10 years of follow-up but thereafter, subjects with cardiac
conduction abnormalities had a higher risk of death33. In a larger series of 453 consecutive SLE
patients, 84% of whom were taking HCQ, 16% had cardiac conduction abnormalities34. Since
were not able to attribute them directly to the use of HCQ. In fact, higher cumulative doses of
HCQ were associated with fewer conduction abnormalities. QTc prolongation was rare and only
the incidence of conduction delays and QT prolongation was similar to what is expected in the
general public35.
There are currently more than 7.15 million confirmed cased of COVID-19 world-wide.
Initially, HCQ has emerged as a potential therapy for COVID-19 given in vitro evidence of
antiviral properties11,36. Guidelines quickly emerged cautioning the use of the medication in
the arrhythmic toxicity risk of HCQ is likely low given the relatively short duration of treatment for
COVID-1937. They recommend using caution in patients with known congenital long QT
syndrome, renal insufficiency, on QT prolonging medications (e.g. certain antiarrhythmics,
antipsychotics, antifungals, and macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin), or with electrolyte
caution when using HCQ +/- azithromycin in any patient with a prolonged QTc > 470msec in
males and >480 msec in females12. Most recently, a small randomized controlled trial and
several observational studies of COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ showed no evidence of
benefit and some concerning trends for harm14–17,40. At this moment, the FDA has removed the
combination with azithromycin, except in the context of a clinical trial41. However, despite the
negative trials the medication has received significant media attention and it remains possible
that a significant portion of the population is exposed to the medication. The association of
impaired kidney function with QTc prolongation is especially concerning since reports from
China indicate that patients with COVID-19 are more likely to experience renal dysfunction42.
Given the higher co-morbidity burden and acuity of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, it is
possible that a higher percentage would exhibit QTc prolongation with HCQ treatment.
The current report provides contemporary information on the effect of HCQ on QTc to
support the above recommendations. While the additional prolongation of QTc with HCQ was in
general modest, substantial prolongation occurred in 3.2% of the patients. Guidelines for
performing screening ECGs and recommendations for monitoring patients started on HCQ have
been proposed18,43. Therefore, it is prudent to check a baseline ECG prior to initiating therapy,
avoid hypokalemia and monitor patients with impaired kidney function and those taking other
QT prolonging medications closely38,39. Although this study did not include genetic data, extra
precautions are also recommended in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.
This study showed that 1.5% of patients taking HCQ had QTc >500 msec. Class III
antiarrhythmic medications dofetilide and sotalol, used for the treatment atrial fibrillation, can
also cause QT prolongation. In the DIAMOND-CHF study, dofetilide was discontinued in 2% of
the patients for QT prolongation44. However, more recent data from general practice showed
that dofetilide was discontinued in up to 17% of patients due to QT prolongation38. Sotalol, on
the other hand, was discontinued in 4.3% of patients due to prolonged QT interval45. The results
of the current study should be evaluated within this context.
We acknowledge the limitations of this study. There may be a selection bias for patients
who had ECGs while on therapy. Patients with SLE are different from ill patients with COVID-19
who are likely to have a higher burden of cardiovascular comorbidities and impaired kidney
function making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of HCQ. Further, HCQ has a long
half-life. Steady state is achieved after 3-4 months of therapy46. The average time on HCQ at
the time the ECG was performed in this study was 237 (92-575) days suggesting that steady
state had been achieved. However, patients treated for COVID-19 are likely to receive shorter
courses of therapy and this study cannot address expected ECG changes in this timeframe.
Finally, this study was retrospective, lacked genetic diagnostics and largely consisted of men.
Hydroxychloroquine therapy is associated with QT prolongation in a significant fraction of
patients who were on chronic therapy with this medication for SLE. While recent trials have not
supported the expansion of HCQ use for COVID-19, it has raised significant concerns with QT
prolongation and arrhythmogenic risk. Avoiding hypokalemia and carefully monitoring of QTc
are warranted; particularly in those with impaired kidney function and those receiving other QT
prolonging drugs.
