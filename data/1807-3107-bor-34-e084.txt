stract: The present study sought to evaluate the impact of  quar‐
antine  resulting  from  the  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)
pandemic on dental appointments and patients positions  and  con‐
cerns regarding their ongoing dental treatment. Patients from re‐
garding their treatment, availability and willingness  to  attend
dental  appointments,  and concerns about contamination. Descrip‐
tive statistics of the responses were performed with  percentages
and responses were compared between sexes, regions, and other as‐
pects using the chi‐squared test. Five  hundred  ninety‐five  pa‐
tients  (412  females  and  183 males; mean age: 38.21 years) an‐
swered the questionnaire. Most patients reported  they  were  re‐
ceiving  dental  treatment  (orthodontics)  and would attend to a
dental  appointment;  meanwhile,  those  patients  not  receiving
treatment  would not attend or would visit only in the case of an
emergency. Males reported to be calmer  than  females,  who  were
more  anxious and afraid; as such, males reported more willing to
go a dental appointment while, in general, females were not  wor‐
ried about how quarantine could affect dental treatment. Patients
actively undergoing treatment and orthodontic patients were  more
concerned about a delay in treatment. There was a significant as‐
sociation between feelings about the COVID‐19  pandemic  and  the
level  of willingness to attend a dental appointment. The quaran‐
tine recommended due to the COVID‐19 pandemic was shown  to  have
an  impact  on  dental appointments and the anxiety levels of pa‐
tients, since there was a  significant  association  between  pa‐
tients feelings and their willingness to attend a dental appoint‐
ment. Overall, patients undergoing dental treatment and orthodon‐
tics  were  more  willing  to attend an appointment and were more
concerned about an increase  in  treatment  duration.   Keywords:

1, 2020 Last revision: June 18, 2020 The severe acute respiratory
syndrome  coronavirus  2  (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus, responsible now for
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) cases  worldwide,  originated
in  Wuhan,  China, in late 2019 and, some months later, the World
Health Organization (WHO) labeled the  virus  spread  across  the
globe  as  a pandemic. The risk assessment according to the Braz.
Oral Res. 2020;34:e084 How does  the  quarantine  resulting  from
COVID‐19  impact  dental appointments and patient anxiety levels?
WHO for COVID‐19, a viral infection caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, is very
high,  with  a  global  impact.  As of April 12, 2020, there were
1,696,588 confirmed cases of COVID‐19, including 105,952  deaths,
reported  by  the WHO.1 To date, the countries that have suffered
the most from the COVID‐19 pandemic include China, Italy,  Spain,
the  United  Kingdom,  and  the United States.  Infection control
measures are being designed and world to prevent the  virus  from
further  spreading and to help in controlling the pandemic situa‐
tion.2 Many of these countries  have  implemented  strategies  to
slow  the  expansion  and  infection of SARS‐CoV‐2, including the
provision of virus tests,  extreme  social  isolation,  localized
quarantines,  and  the  monitoring of the most vulnerable popula‐
tions; the measures taken are largely guided by the official  WHO
website  based on the number of cases in each country.3 Given the
SARS‐CoV‐2 virus may easily infect an individual through  contact
with  secretions  or  aerosols and, due to the characteristics of
dental care, the risk of  cross‐infection  between  patients  and
dental  practitioners  is  high.4  To  limit  the  advance of the
COVID‐19, the adoption of strict and effective infection  control
protocols  is  urgent. In this sense, besides the recommendations
for good hand hygiene and the importance of thorough disinfection
of  all  surfaces of the dental clinics,5,6 guidelines and recom‐
mendations for the management of dental  practitioners  and  stu‐
dents  are  necessary.4 In many places at this time, dentists are
not allowed to provide conventional dental treatment,  being  in‐
stead  restricted  to  only  handling urgencies a nd emergencies.
Elsewhere, qua ra nt i ne is recommended but dental  offices  are
still  able  to  stay open while following the recommendations of
the federal board of dentistry and national dental associations.7
Amid  this  situation, patients remain uncertain about whether to
attend their dental appointments or not. However, little is known
about  this  feeling  and the level of anxiety experienced by pa‐
tients regarding the continuity or interruption of dental  treat‐
ment  and  the resulting impact, as we are facing a new situation
not experienced  previously  by  any  of  us.   Braz.  Oral  Res.
2020;34:e084  This  study therefore aimed to assess the impact of
quarantine due to the COVID‐19 pandemic on dental  care  and  ap‐
pointments  and  clarify  patients  positions  and concerns about
their ongoing dental treatments.  This study was approved by  the
Ethics Research A sample‐size calculation for the included survey
was performed considering the total of  2,000  patients  of  five
private dental clinics, with a margin of error of 5% and a confi‐
dence level of 95%. The results showed the need for at least  323
responses.   An informative survey by which patients could report
how they were feeling about the pandemic  and  how  anxious  they
were about their oral health and dental treatment plan was devel‐
oped. A Google Forms questionnaire (Google  LLC,  Mountain  View,
CA,  USA) was sent to 1,000 randomly selected patients of private
dental clinics from the clinicians A. A. M., K. M. S. F.,  F.  P.
V.,  N. I. P. P., and R. C. G. O., located mainly in three metro‐
politan cities of three  different  regions  of  Brazil:  Maring,
Paran  (in  the  south);  Bauru, So Paulo (in the southeast); and
Porto Velho, Rondnia (in the north). The link with the  question‐
naire  was sent by WhatsApp Messenger (WhatsApp Inc., Menlo Park,
CA, USA) only once. Patients also had support for doubts  regard‐
ing  the questions and answers, if needed. Patients and their re‐
spective doctors were  not  identified.  Eligible  patients  were
those  older  than  18 years of age and who agreed to participate
when answering the questionnaire.   Participants  answered  ques‐
tions  about their age, sex, the city in which they live, whether
they had any symptoms related to COVID‐19,  and  whether  or  not
they  were  undergoing  dental treatment andif yeswhich specialty
(e.g., orthodontic,  restorative).  In  addition,  they  reported
whether  or  not their dentist had gotten in touch to schedule an
appointment or return, if they would agree  to  go,  or  if  they
would  only  go  in  the case of an emergency and what were their
concerns both about attending a dental appointment and how  quar‐
antine  might  affect their dental treatment Peloso RM, Pini NIP,

The  questionnaire was available for use for only 48 hours, in an
early stage of the pandemic. Responses were obtained and tabulat‐
ed in Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, USA) for statistical anal‐
ysis.  Braz. Oral Res. 2020;34:e084 How does the  quarantine  re‐
sulting from COVID‐19 impact dental appointments and patient anx‐
iety levels?  To test the reliability of the answers to the ques‐
tionnaire,  question  9  was  repeated  twice in the survey. This
question was chosen for repetition because it has only three  re‐
sponses,  including  yes  or no, and was a critical and important
question in the survey.  This allowed us to calculate  an  intra‐
class  correlation  coefficient  of  0.86,  suggesting  excellent
agreement.  Statistical analysis Descriptive  statistics  of  the
responses  were  performed,  with percentages. Comparisons of pa‐
tients undergoing dental treatment or  not  and  orthodontic  pa‐
tients  versus  those  receiving treatment from other specialties
both between the sexes and among the three regions where the  pa‐
tients  live were conducted using the chi‐squared test.  To check
the presence of an association between feelings about  quarantine
and  the  COVID‐19 pandemic and willingness to go to a dental ap‐
pointment, the chi‐square test was applied.  Statistical analysis
was  performed  with the Statistica version 10.0 software program
(Statsoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA) and the results were stated as  sig‐
nificant  for  p  <  0.05.  Five hundred ninety‐five patients an‐
swered the questionnaire. The response rate was 59.5%.  The  mean
age  of  the  participants  was  38.21 years (standard deviation:
13.94 years) (Q1). Most of the  patients  were  female  (412/595;
69.2%), with a mean age of 38.53 years (standard deviation: 13.41
years); meanwhile, among the males (183/595; 30.8%), the mean age
was  37.49 years (standard deviation: 15.07) (Q2). Of the 176 pa‐
tients were from the southeast (29.6%), 239 were from  the  south
(40.2%), and 180 were from the north (30.2%) regions, respective‐
ly.  Only  six  respondents  (1%)  reported  having  symptoms  of
COVID‐19  (Q3  and  Q4).   With respect to the quarantine (Q5 and
Q6), 78% (464/595) said they were actively going  out  in  public
only  when  needed,  12.8% (76/595) were not leaving home at all,
and 4.5% (27/595) were conducting normal activities and going out
regularly. Only 4.7% Braz. Oral Res. 2020;34:e084 (28/595) of re‐
spondents said they were not in favor of the quarantine. Most pa‐
tients (324/595; 54.4%) reported they were working or studying at
home, while 27.7% (165/595) were going out for work or study. The
remaining  respondents  (106/595;  17.8%) were not conducting any
work or study.  Regarding feelings about the COVID‐19 pandemic in
the  early stage (Q7), 41.8% (249/595) of the patients were calm,
28.6% (170/595) reported experiencing  anxiety,  23.2%  (138/595)
exhibited  fear  of the disease, 2.2% (13/595) were panicked, and
4.2% (25/595) difference between patients under treatment or  not

tionnaire  was  answered  than  not  (241/595;  40.5%)  (Q8). The
type(s) of treatment (Q8) being  performed  included  orthodontic
(263;  74.3%), oral rehabilitation (65; 18.4%), or restorative or
other (26; 7.3%).  Among  the  patients  under  treatment,  38.3%
(228/595)  stated  they  would  go to a dental appointment if the

dental appointment (Q10) included the risk  of  getting  infected
and/or  contaminating  the family (110/595; 18.5%); while only 5%
(30/595) said they were afraid because dentists are  a  group  at
high  risk of contamination. Several patients answered that their
treatment is not urgent and can wait (120/595;  20.2%)  and  most
(335/595;  56.3%)  showed  no concern in answering this question.
Considering the concerns of the respondents about how  quarantine
might affect ongoing dental treatment plans (Q11), half (304/595;

with the release of first  impressions  of  epidemiological  data
concerning  the COVID19 pandemic,8,9 the conduct of studies about
how this global event may impact mental health have  been  recom‐
mended.10  When  the  questionnaire  in  this  study was deployed
(April 2020) the pandemic was still in  a  very  early  stage  in
Brazil  and  relatively under control in comparison with in other
countries, with less than 1,000 deaths due to COVID‐19 and  about
17,000  confirmed  cases reported.11 According to experts, at the
moment of Braz. Oral Res. 2020;34:e084 How  does  the  quarantine
resulting  from  COVID‐19  impact dental appointments and patient
anxiety levels?  the survey, the  COVID‐19  infection  curve  was
still rising and was far from reaching its peak in Brazil.  Since
infections were actively spreading;12 however, some control  mea‐
sures,  such  as quarantine, were recommended. When the question‐
naire in this study was sent to prospective respondents,  quaran‐
tine  had been recommended for about three weeks in all cities of
the patients selected for inclusion. Some impacts,  such  as  in‐
creased stress about behaviors that may lead to contamination and
greater levels of depression attributed to social distancing  and
isolation,  are  related  to  increased  vulnerability  of mental
health.10 As such, while the primary intention of this survey was
to  evaluate the effects of quarantine on dental treatments, this
study also provide some insights about the  level  of  awareness,
perceptions,  and  attitudes of patients in response to this pan‐
demic.  The survey results in this study revealed that  most  pa‐
tients  (78%)  were  respecting the quarantine and going out only
when really necessary, such as to buy food and medicine, and many
(54.55%)  were  working from home. Patients were largely aware of
the seriousness of the COVID‐19 pandemic and  reported  concerns,
even  though  this  study  was conducted at an early stage of the
pandemic in Brazil. However, even then,  most  patients  reported
not feeling calm in relation to the situation: 28.6% reported ex‐
periencing anxiety and 23.2% felt scared. This may be due to  the
availability  of  media reports from around the world by means of
television and the Internet.  The purpose of this study  was  not
to  discuss  the  effectiveness of the quarantine. In Brazil, the
government suggested starting quarantine early, about four  weeks
before  the  application  of this survey, when the first cases of
COVID‐19 were confirmed in the country and before the  virus  had
spread  significantly.  Elective  dental  treatments, such as or‐
thodontic and esthetic procedures, were not deemed essential  and
were  postponed. Following the WHO recommendations, dental treat‐
ments were restricted to conduct only in emergency  situations.13
The  focus  of  the present study was therefore to assess the de‐
grees of anxiety and concern among patients, especially with  re‐
gard  to  ongoing  dental treatments deemed to be elective in na‐
ture.  Braz. Oral Res. 2020;34:e084 Of all the patients  who  an‐
swered the questionnaire, 38.3% reported they would attend a den‐
tal appointment if the dentist/staff called to schedule and 44.2%
reported  they would go only in the case of an emergency.  Howev‐
er, when only patients actively undergoing dental treatment  were
considered,  the  percentage that would attend an appointment in‐
creased to 55.9% in contrast with 27% of the  patients  who  were
not receiving active treatment. Most respondents who were not re‐
ceiving active treatment (51.4%) answered that they would  attend
an  appointment only if it was an emergency. This indicates, in a
certain way, that patients in the middle of a course  of  therapy
show  greater  care  and  attention regarding their treatment and
probably would not miss an appointment  to  avoid  impairing  the
outcome  of their treatment. This is clearly evidenced in the re‐
sults that show that patients under treatment  are  more  worried
than patients not under treatment. When comparing the sexes, wom‐
en were less worried about a delay in reaching the  end  Patients
undergoing dental treatment were more concerned about an increase
in the duration of their treatment (43.2%) than  those  under  no
treatment  more  concerned  about a delay (48.7%) than those This
concern among  orthodontic  patients  regarding  finishing  their
treatment  is  justifiable  since  orthodontic treatments usually
last longer  than  most  dental  treatments.14,15  Besides,  each
missed  appointment  tends  to increase the orthodontic treatment
time on average by 1.09 months.16 Considering insights  into  re‐
spondents  feelings  about  quarantine, it can be considered that
most of the patients, regardless of being under treatment or not,
shared  that they were anxious or scared in were more anxious and
afraid than men, who were Despite the literature suggesting that,
under  normal  situations,  women  are more compliant with dental
treatment than men,17 their feelings of anxiety and fear in  this
study  affected their willingness to attend a dental appointment.
Probably, women felt safer Peloso RM, Pini NIP, Sundfeld Neto  D,
Mori  AA, Oliveria RCG, Valarelli FP, Freitas KMS staying at home
or going to the dentist only in the case of an  emergency.  These
results  corroborate  with several findings that females are more
emotionally affected by difficult situations and are more  likely
than men to report symptoms of stress and anxiety.18 This was re‐
inforced when women reported they were less worried about  delays
in  dental  treatment than men. This may be possibly explained by
the fact that women are more worried about the situation  of  the
COVID‐19 pandemic outbreak and concerned about other problems re‐
lating to health, financial/economic aspects, and social distanc‐
ing,  among others. Dental treatments are mostly nonessential and
can wait until the situation normalizes.  The comparisons between
select  regions  of Brazil revealed some differences. In general,
respondents in the south region reported greater levels of  anxi‐
ety  and fear and most patients from this area would go to a den‐
tal appointment only in case of an emergency. Those in the  north
were the least affected among residents of the three regions when
the survey was applied and this is  probably  why  patients  from
this  region  were  calmer and more willing to go to a dental ap‐
pointment. Regardless of sex or  region,  however,  the  feelings
about quarantine and the COVID‐19 pandemic were significantly as‐
sociated with the willingness to go to a dental appointment. Calm
or  indifferent  patients were more willing to attend an appoint‐
ment, while most of the patients who  reported  feeling  anxious,
afraid, or panicked said they would go only in the As the pandem‐
ic is still not under control, dentists are  advised  to  contact
patients ongoing dental treatment regularly and, if possible, re‐
lay instructions about oral health maintenance and emergency han‐
dling.13,19 The COVID‐19 pandemic has driven an increase in tele‐
dentistry20 as well as telemedicine and  telepsychiatry,21  where
dentists  can  use  information  and  communication technology to
their advantage, assisting and advising patients, reducing  their
anxiety  about  the  treatment duration, and supporting good out‐
comes and oral health and care.  However, there are situations in
which  a  dental appointment is necessary. In these cases, guide‐
lines from the Centers for Disease Control  and  Prevention,  the
American   Dental   Association,  and  the  WHO  should  be  fol‐
lowed.13,22,23 Besides the abovementioned recommendations, exten‐
sive care concerning disinfection and sanitization methods of the
clinical environment have been suggested.19 The results  of  this
study  revealed  that  patients, undergoing treatment or not, are
interested in this.24 The data of this survey  are  important  to
show  that  the  patients  are aware and that following available
recommendations is important  to  maintain  their  confidence  in
health care professionals and their compliance with dental treat‐
ment both now and when the quarantine ends.  A limitation of this
survey is the moderate range and limited coverage of the countrys
entire population. However, up until now, data  like  these  were
reported  in  the  literature only using an orthodontic sample,24
due to the singularity of the actual  moment,  which,  for  sure,
will  imply  permanent  modifications in several health treatment
areas, including dentistry. The sample was  nonprobabilistic  and
did  not allow for population generalization; however, this study
still provides a quick overview of the concerns and positions  of
patients  during quarantine in Brazil. Further, while the conclu‐
sions are pertinent to Brazil, this survey brings useful informa‐
tion,  particularly  as many dental offices may soon reopen after
spending some time closed and dentists should know what they  can
expect  regarding  patients anxiety and concerns.  The quarantine
recommended due to the COVID19 pandemic was shown to have an  im‐
pact  on dental appointments and patients anxiety since there was
a significant association found  between  patients  feelings  and
their willingness to attend a dental appointment.  Ongoing dental
treatment is a factor leading patients to be more willing to  at‐
tend  an  appointment.   Patients  undergoing treatment were more
