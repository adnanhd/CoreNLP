Muhammad Wasif Saif* Introduction: While the global COVID‐19 pan‐
demic has challenged the entire humanity and health  systems,  it
also triggered researchers to urgently perform clinical trials to
assess the safety and efficacy of many agents and  modalities  to
combat  COVID‐19.  As of April 22, over 650 clinical studies have
been registered both in USA  and  internationally.  Results  from
these  studies  are  also coming at a brisk pace in this unprece‐
dented emergency.  Areas covered: We searched the NCI website and
Medline and summarize various national and international clinical
trials and summarize few of the pivotal ones in this  paper,  in‐
cluding  those  specific  to oncology population. Two hundred and
eighty four studies are actively recruiting adults  and  children
with  confirmed COVID‐19, including 25 are early‐phase I/phase I,
72 phase II, 58 phase III, 12 phase IV, and 31 other trials. They
can  be  categorized  into  four  groups: drugs that combat SARS‐
CoV‐2, immunomodulatory agents to counteract cytokine storm, con‐
valescence plasma therapies and vaccines trials.  Expert opinion:
It is hoped that these  efforts  will  results  in  a  successful
treatment  to COVID‐19, especially in a timely fashion before the
second pandemic expected in fall. It is essential to  acknowledge
the  devotion  and  hard  work  of the clinical research team and
clinical research COVID‐19;  Immunosuppression;  SARS‐CoV‐2;  Im‐
munomodulatory;  Cytokine  storm;  Convalescent plasma; Vaccines;
BCG Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  (SARS‐CoV‐2)
causes  the  novel  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) which was
first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019.  Since  then  it
has  spread  to  more  than  200 countries. As of April 20, 2020,
there have been more than 2.5 million reported cases and  170,000
deaths  worldwide  [1].   SARS‐CoV‐2 is a positive sense, single‐
strand enveloped RNA virus that shares close  genetic  similarity
to corona viruses from previous outbreaks ‐ the severe acute res‐
piratory Chi et al.  syndrome corona virus (SARS‐COV) and  Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). The common man‐
ifestations from COVID‐19 are  cough  (86.1%),  fever  or  chills
(85.0%),  and  shortness of breath (80.0%) which are very similar
to influenza but the case fatality rate of COVID‐19 is much  high
and  estimated  to  be at 310%. Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, and obesity are some
of  the prevalent conditions that may increase the risk of hospi‐
talizations [2]. The severe cases of COVID‐19 with high mortality
are  associated with reduced innate and adaptive immune responses
in conjunction with abundant cytokine and overexpression  of  in‐
terleukin 6 (IL‐6) [3,4]. These patients present with lymphopenia
with markedly decreased number of CD4 and CD8  T  cells,  natural
killer  cells  and monocytes [4]. The United States Food and Drug
compassionate use in treating patients with COVID  19.   Although
there  are  many  ongoing  clinical trials, currently there is no
strong evidence from clinical trials, treatment  strategies,  and
clinical experience in treating COVID‐19 with a focus on oncology
patients.  The Current Landscape of Clinical Trials for  COVID‐19
Currently  there  are  657  registered clinical trials related to
SARS‐CoV‐2 as of April 20th, 2020. Of these trials, 284  are  ac‐
tively recruiting adults and children with confirmed COVID‐19 for
in‐patient and outpatient pharmacological interventions.  Of  the
284  trials,  25 are Early‐phase I/Phase I, 72 Phase II, 58 Phase
III, 12 Phase IV, and 31 other trials. They  can  be  categorized
into  1) drugs that combat SARS‐CoV‐2, 2) immunomodulatory agents
to Trials with Drugs against SARS‐CoV‐2  Viral  Replication  Many
agents  in  this  category  are  already  approved by the FDA for
treating other diseases.  They have generally have proven  safety
profile  and  tolerability  from previous clinical experience. In
vitro studies of these agents showed antiviral activities against
SARS‐VoV‐2  Chloroquine  and  its derivative, Hydroxychloroquine,
have been widely used to treat malarial and  autoimmune  disease.
Chloroquine  blocks  virus  infection by raising endosomal pH re‐
quired for virus‐cell fusion and interferes with  SARS‐CoV‐1  re‐
ceptor  glycosylation [5]. It has also been shown to have similar
inhibitory effects against SARS‐CoV‐2 [6]. A recent Chinese study
showed that Hydroxychloroquine was more potent and tolerable than
chloroquine in vitro [7]. In a recent open‐label,  non‐randomized
trial,  Gautret et al. showed significant reduction in viral load
in COVID‐19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine [8]. Another
observational  study  with  1061  patients  who received hydroxy‐
chloroquine and azithromycin  showed  good  viral  clearance  and
safety  profile  [9].  Currently,  there  are 101 clinical trials
worldwide using hydroxychloroquine either by itself or in  combi‐
nation  with other agents for treating COVID‐19 [10].  Chi et al.
Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue. It causes premature termina‐
tion of viral RNA replication when incorporated into growing RNA.
It was initially developed as a trial drug for treatment of Ebola
during the height of Ebola outbreak. However, the phase 3 random‐
ized trial yielded negative result [11]. Nevertheless, it  showed
significant  in  vitro antiviral activity against a wide array of
RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae and Corona viridae family includ‐
ing  SARS‐CoV,  MERS‐CoV  and most recently SARS‐CoV‐2 [6]. There
have been reports of anecdotal successful use  of  remdesivir  in
COVID‐19  patients  [12,13].   Currently  there  are many ongoing
clinical trials (e.g. NCT04292899, NCT04292730) to  evaluate  the
efficacy  of  remdesivir in patients with mild to moderate or se‐
vere COVID‐19.  For severe patients, the data for the  first  400
patients  in  the  study  was  finished, will be released any day
(NCT04292899).  Lopinavir‐ritonavir is an FDA  approved  combina‐
tion  antiviral  medication used to treat and prevent HIV. It was
used in the 2003 SARS outbreak and associated  reduced  mortality
and  intubation  rates [14]. In terms of COVID‐19, early case re‐
ports and observational studies showed mix results [14]. However,
a  recent  open label randomized trial in China with 199 patients
with COVID‐19 failed to  show  significant  difference  in  viral
clearance  or 28‐day mortality rates [15]. Although there are ad‐
ditional RCTs ongoing, the current data suggest a limited role of
the  drug  in COVID‐19 treatment.  Arbidol (Umifenovir) targets S
protein/ACE2 interaction, then inhibits membrane  fusion  of  the
viral envelope. It is approved for treatment of influenza in Chi‐
na and Russia. There are total of 4 trials available with  2  re‐
cruiting  for  COVID‐19  patients.   Camostat  mesylate  inhibits
transmembrane serine protease and prevents viral cell  entry.  It
is  primarily  used to treat postoperative reflux esophagitis and
acute pancreatitis in Japan. There are 4 trials available with  2
recruiting   for   CoViD‐19  patients.   Immunomodulatory  Agents
against Cytokine Storm One of the hallmarks of  COVID‐19  disease
course  is  that  is  that the patients can rapidly develop acute
respiratory distress syndrome and multiple‐organ failure  leading
to  death.   Overwhelming cytokine storm is one to the major con‐
tributors to the rapid clinical decline.  Potent  cytokines  such
as  interleukin  (IL) 1, IL2, IL‐6, TNFa, IFN‐,  were noted to be
markedly elevated in  these  patients.  Various  immunomodulatory
agents  are  being  studied  in  patients with severe COVID‐19 to
abate the cytokine storm.  Tocilizumab, an IL‐6 receptor  antago‐
nist,  approved for treatment of cytokine storm due to CAR‐T cell
therapy, giant cell arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  has
been  used to treat severe COVID‐19 patients with cytokine storm.
A report of 21 COVID‐19 patients treated with tocilizumab  showed
improvements  in  terms of respiratory function, rapid defferves‐
cence and early hospital discharge [16]. Ongoing clinical  trials
include NCT04310228, ChiCTR200002976. Sarilumab, another IL‐6 re‐
ceptor antagonist approved for RA, is also being studied in clin‐
ical  trials  (e.g.  NCT04288713) in hospitalized patients Chi et
al.  Anakinra is an IL‐1 receptor  antagonist  (IL‐1ra)  approved
for  RA  and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NO‐
MID). It can block IL‐1 and the downstream inflammatory  effects,
decreasing/stopping  the  cytokine  storm. It is being studied in
clinical trials NCT04339712, NCT04341584. It is also being  stud‐
ied  in  combination  with emapalumab (NCT04324021), a monoclonal
antibody against IFN‐ approved for refractory hemophagocytic lym‐
phohistiocytosis (HLH).  Roxolitinib is an inhibitor of Janus Ki‐
nase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 approved for the treatment  of  myelofibro‐
sis,  polycythemia  vera,  and graft‐versus‐host disease. The JAK
pathway is a potential target as IFN‐ exerts its inflammatory ef‐
fects  via  the JAK/STAT pathway. It can block the downstream ef‐
fects of IFN‐ and other cytokines  reducing  inflammation.   Cur‐
rently   there   are   ongoing   clinical   trials  (NCT04331665,
NCT04338958) to study its efficacy  in  COVID‐19  patients.   Se‐
linexor,  a  nuclear export protein (XPO1) inhibitor approved for
treatment of relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma is another po‐
tential agent to treat COVID‐19 patients. Zhou et al. showed that
both SAR‐CoV‐2 propagation in host cells and  inflammatory  tran‐
scription  factors  require  functional nuclear transport protein
XPO1 [17]. Selinexor can potentially stop viral  replication  and
cytokine  storm  at  the  same time. Its efficacy in COVID‐19 pa‐
tients is being evaluated  in  a  clinical  trial  (NCT04349098).
Acalabrutinib  is  a  Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ap‐
proved for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  and  mantle
cell  lymphoma.  BTK is a key regulator of production of multiple
cytokines and chemokines including TNF‐, IL‐6, IL‐10,  and  MCP‐1
identified  as  elevated in severe COVID‐19 patients. A new study
in Spain is underway  (NCT04346199)  to  study  acalaburtinib  in
COVID‐19  patients.   Convalescent plasma The use of convalescent
plasma and passive immunization has been studied in the treatment
of  respiratory  viral  illnesses (influenza, SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV)
and preliminary data suggests that convalescent plasma may be  of
benefit  in some patients with COVID‐19 [18,19]. Specifically, in
a Chinese study of 5 critically‐ill COVID‐19 patients on mechani‐
cal ventilation, a one‐time administration of convalescent plasma
resulted in clinical improvement of all patients, with 3 patients
being  weaned  off  mechanical ventilation within As of April 19,
2020, there were 5 registered convalescent plasma therapy  clini‐
cal  trials  in COVID‐19 convalescent plasma can be isolated from
the blood of patients who have recovered from  SARS‐CoV‐2  infec‐
tion  and are believed to have developed humoral immunity against
the virus. The collected convalescent plasma can then  be  trans‐
fused  into ABO compatible severe or critically ill patients with
active COVID‐19.  Chi et al.  Vaccine Trials  Effective  vaccina‐
tion to a large portion of the worlds population is needed to ef‐
fectively end the COVID‐19 pandemic. Since the World Health Orga‐
nization  declared  the  COVID‐19 outbreak as a pandemic in early
March, tremendous effort and funding have been allocated  to  de‐
veloping  vaccines  against SARS‐CoV‐2. DNA and RNA‐based vaccine
platforms can ramp up production rapidly as no cell incubation is
required.  Developing  recombinantsubunit  vaccines  require cell
culture or fermentation process which can take longer.  Currently
multiple  development  platforms are being utilized [20]. Experts
estimate that it can take 1218 months  to  develop  a  successful
vaccine ready for the general population.  There are currently as
many as 70 vaccine candidates in the preclinical stage.  Some  of
the  Bacillus  Calmete‐Guerin  (BCG),  a  live attenuated vaccine
originally used against tuberculosis, is being repurposed against
SARS‐COV‐2.  There  are several ongoing phase III clinical trials
internationally (NCT04327206, NCT04348370, NCT04328441)  recruit‐
ing  healthcare  workers  as  participants.  Ad5‐nCoV is an aden‐
ovirus type‐5 vector‐based recombinant vaccine engineered to pro‐
duce  SARS‐CoV‐2  spike protein developed by CanSino Biologics in
China. The vaccine completed recruitment for the  phase  I  trial
(single  center,  open  label,  dose escalation) in China. It has
commenced to a double‐blind, phase II RCT (NCT04341389) and  plan
to  enroll 500 healthy subjects.  (NCT04283461) is now recruiting
candidates across the United States. The  vaccine  candidate  was
developed  by ModernaTX and supported by NIH.  I/II single‐blind‐
ed, RCT (NCT04324606). The study involves 3 arms with 5 interven‐
tions.  The study plans to recruit 510 healthy volunteers in Eng‐
land.  INO‐4800, a DNA  vaccine  candidate  developed  by  Inovio
Pharmaceuticals,  is being studied in an open‐label phase I trial
(NCT04336410) to evaluate the safe, tolerability and immunogenic‐
ity  of  the  vaccine.  The vaccine is administered intradermally
followed by electroporation. It plans to recruit 40 healthy  vol‐
unteers  in  the United States.  LV vaccine (LV‐SMENP) is made by
modifying  dendritic  cells  with  lentivirus  vector  expressing
COVID‐19  minigene protein from Covid‐19 to activate T cells. The
phase I/II study (NCT04276896) plans to recruit 100  participants
in  Shenzhen,  China.   COVID‐19 in Cancer Patients Patients with
cancer are particularly vulnerable with increased mortality asso‐
ciated  with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection relative to the general popula‐
tion. Cancer patients are typically Chi et al.   immunosuppressed
with  high  healthcare utilization requirements which likely con‐
tributes to high transmission rates  and  poorer  outcomes.  Both
Chinese  and Italian data demonstrated that the mortality rate of
cancer patients with COVID 19 were 39% and 20% although the  sam‐
ple  size  was  smaller with different demographics [21,22]. Both
the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American
Society  of  Hematology  (ASH) have provided institutional policy
recommendations to guide the timing of  initiation  of  treatment
and  alternatives to standard treatment regimens during this time
when resources are limited and risk of potentially life‐threaten‐
ing COVID‐19 infection is high. In addition, the FDA has provided
general guidance as to the management of clinical  trials  during
the pandemic, many of which are no longer accruing or temporarily
on hold. At the present time, cancer patients  are  eligible  for
the  vast majority of COVID‐19 clinical trials regardless of can‐
cer directed treatment status. In the  United  States  there  are
currently 2 intervention studies specifically designed for cancer
patients and there are 8 observational studies  specifically  The
COVID‐19  pandemic  is  wreaking  havoc across the world, causing
high number of morbidities and mortalities. It  is  the  greatest
global health crisis of our generation. The case fatality rate is
estimated to be 3  10%. However, given the extremely high  infec‐
tious  rate,  there are now over 2.5 million confirmed cases with
staggering 175,000 deaths worldwide as of April 20, 2020. For on‐
cology  patients  with  COVID‐19,  the case fatality rate is even
higher, especially those who are on  active  chemotherapy  treat‐
ment. The mortality rate of hospitalized COVID‐19 cancer patients
can be as high as 30% (our own institutional data;  n=30).  Heath
care  centers  across the globe are using various agents to treat
COVID‐19 as there are no effective therapies to date with  strong
evidence.  However,  it is encouraging to see the high volume and
speed of the ongoing clinical trials. High quality evidence‐based
guidelines  are  needed  urgently to standardize the treatment of
COVID‐19 especially for this vulnerable oncology patient  popula‐
tion.  This study is supported by US NIH grants 2UG1CA189850.  1.
