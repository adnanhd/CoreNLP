Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease initially reported in
China and currently worldwide dispersed caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or
2019‑nCoV) affecting more than seven million people around the world causing more than
400 thousand deaths (on June 8th, 2020). The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the clinical
and epidemiological history of the patient. However, the gold standard for COVID-19
diagnosis is the viral detection through the amplification of nucleic acids. Although the
quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has been described
as the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19, there are several difficulties involving its
use. Here we comment on RT-PCR and describe alternative tests developed for the diagnosis
of COVID-19.

In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported
in Hubei province, Wuhan municipality, China. In January 2020, the etiologic
agent was isolated and described by the Chinese government as a new coronavirus
SARS-CoV2 is one of seven human-infecting coronaviruses identified so far. It is
a single strand positive sense RNA virus (+)ssRNA belonging to the β-coronavirus
lineage B1-3. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
disease COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV2, as a pandemic and according to WHO,
there were more than seven million confirmed cases worldwide and more than
400 thousand deaths (on June 8th, 2020)1,5.
SARS-CoV-2 genome codes for a polyprotein (ORF1ab) involved in the
transcription and replication of the viral RNA, four structural proteins: E for envelope;
M for membrane; N for nucleocapsid that is necessary for the viral synthesis and the
S protein for Spike, that allows the entry and the infection of the host cell, in addition
to five accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10)1,3,6,7.
The viral S protein binds to the human ACE2 receptor, causing conformational
changes in the coronavirus and allowing its fusion to the host cell membrane. The
process of entering the cell requires the action of the TMPRSS2 protease, which
regulates the cleavage of the S protein6,8.
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 disease comprises a broad range of
unspecified symptoms, such as fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache, sputum

production, hemoptysis, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and abdominal pain1,3,4,9,10. Loss of smell and
taste were not commonly described in China, but have
been reported more recently as an early clinical marker of
COVID-19 patients may be classified as asymptomatic
or symptomatic, and the symptoms can vary from mild
to severe and critical1,3,13. The severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) is more common among people with
risk factors, such as advanced age, smoking and those
with associated comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, obesity, chronic lung disease, kidney
Once humans are infected, they begin to transmit
the virus through droplets, sneezing, aerosols1,4,10. Some
findings in the literature suggest that patients with none or
only mild symptoms can release large amounts of viruses
during the initial stage of the infection1,10,15,16, favoring the
rapid spread of the virus1,10,14,17,18. However, Pan et al.19,
in a study with 26 asymptomatic patients noticed that
transmission by asymptomatic patients was less frequent
than by symptomatic ones, suggesting that asymptomatic
patients are less infectious.
The disease incubation period varies from 3-14 days,
with an initial estimated basic reproduction number (R0)
of 2.2, that is, each patient transmits the infection to
other 2.2 individuals1,4. However, with the accumulated
experience and higher numbers of patients in different
countries, mathematical and epidemiological studies
estimated COVID-19 R0 varying from 1.4 to 6.472,10,17,
depending on the isolation and quarantine, as well as other
control measures10,16.
Due to the high transmission rate of SARS-CoV2,
specific measures are urgently needed to contain the
pandemic, such as the improvement of diagnostic methods
for the detection of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic
patients during the early phases of the disease. In this mini
currently available1,2,14.
Laboratory methods
The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the clinical
and epidemiological history of the patient, as well as on
ancillary exams findings, for instance the chest X-ray and
especially the chest tomography (CT-scan) revealing the
characteristic images of ground glass, that were also seen
in asymptomatic patients. However, the gold standard for
COVID-19 diagnosis is through the analysis of nucleic
acids, that is, the demonstration of SARS-CoV2 RNA in
respiratory samples9,19-21.
Non-specific exams
Laboratory findings include leukopenia and lymphopenia
in 80% of the cases, depletion of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes,
also suggested changes in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in
the severe disease progression of COVID-19 patients1,10,22.
Increased inflammatory markers have also been
described in COVID-19: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein
(CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), troponin,
ferritin, creatine kinase (CK) and D-dimer, in addition to
the extended prothrombin time1,10,22.
Severely ill patients may have high levels of cytokines
IL2, IL4, IL6, IL7, IL10 and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)1,10,22. In patients with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome, the so-called cytokines storms was observed,
with the release of the previously mentioned cytokines in
addition to others, such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10,
leading to multiple organs failure and eventually to
The quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
In January 2020, the novel coronavirus was isolated
from Wuhan’s patients providing information on the viral
genetic sequencing, available at the Global Initiative
on Sharing All Influenza Data – GISAID, allowing the
development of the specific diagnostic methods for
COVID-19 through quantitative Reverse-Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) system, i.e,
quantitative Real Time amplifications preceded by RNA
extraction from the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
secretions, followed by a reverse transcription step to
convert RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) that will
undergo amplification. The RT-PCRs that have been applied
to COVID-19 diagnosis contain fluorescent probes that will
recognize and hybridize to segments of the amplification
products, increasing the assays specificity1,26,27.
The RT-PCR is the gold standard for the confirmation
of COVID-19 disease in upper respiratory samples
(nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretion). Several
RT-PCR protocols were released by WHO to provide a
The RT-PCR protocol designed by the Institut Pasteur
(France) showed excellent results in comparison with the
protocol from Charité (Germany), considered the reference
RT-PCR, reaching nearly 95% assertiveness in samples
containing around 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 genome.
In this protocol, two targets from the RNA-dependent
RNA Polymerase (RdRP) gene of SARS-CoV-2 were
the primers were combined in multiplex RT-PCR assays
resulting in the detection of samples containing 10 copies
of the virus genome29. The specificity was evaluated using
samples containing other respiratory viruses (H1N1, H3N2,
B-Victoria, B-Yamagata, influenza C, RSV A and B, hBoV,
hPIV, hMPV, HRV/enterovirus, adenovirus, HKU1, OC43,
229E and NL63) and none of them was detected with the
RdRp gene/nCoV-IP2 and 429.
Although RT-PCR has been described as the gold
standard for diagnosing COVID-19, there are several
difficulties involving its use1,10,23,28,30. The RT-PCR kit
distributed by China’s CDC was designed to detect the
nucleocapsid (N) and the Open Reading Frame ORF1ab
of SARS- CoV-2 genome, and the infection is confirmed
not infrequent that the results are inconsistent due to the
amplification of only one of the targets10,23.
One of the bottlenecks related to RT-PCR for the
diagnosis of COVID-19 is the incorrect collection and
processing of samples. Some studies suggest that samples
obtained from the upper respiratory tract (bottom of the
nostrils and the oropharynx)1,9,10 are optimal clinical
samples due the high viral copy number in the respiratory
tract. In addition to oral and nasal swabs, viral load levels
can be detected in the gastrointestinal tract and eventually
in blood samples, however in lower amounts27,28,31.
A study performed by Yang et al.32, using different
samples (throat swabs, nasal swabs, sputum and broncho
alveolar lavage fluid – BALF) collected in different period
of times (0 to 7, 8 to 14, and more than 15 days after the
onset of disease) evidenced that except for BALF, sputum
samples presented the highest positivity rate (74.4% and
88.9%) , followed by nasal swabs (53.6% and 73.3%) from
severely and mildly symptomatic patients in the first 14 days
after the onset of disease, respectively. After 15 days of the
onset of disease, sputum and nasal swabs presented lower
positive rates (42.9% and 61.1%, respectively)32,33. BALF
was considered important for monitoring and diagnosing
severe cases, while throat swabs presented the lowest
positivity among the samples32,33.
A report of two Korean patients found different viral
load kinetics suggesting variations among infected people.
In the first patient the virus was detected between two and
three days after the onset of symptoms in both, the lower
and the upper respiratory tract. However, viral load levels

decreased on the 7th day, remaining positive until the
13th day. In the second patient, the virus was detected on the
14th day of symptoms in the lower and the upper respiratory
coming back positive on the 25th day33.
To ensure the best performance of the technique and to
avoid RNA degradation, following the swabs collection, the
samples are immersed in a transport medium/lysis buffer or
a sterile saline solution1,29,31,34. Specimens should be stored
at 2-8 °C for up to 72 h after sampling. When the test will not
be performed in a short period of time, the samples should be
stored at much lower temperatures, at least of -70 ° C29,34,35.
Another difficulty in carrying out RT-PCR is the delay
in releasing results during the pandemic1,10. The RNA
extraction step, part of the diagnostic protocol, is time
consuming, especially if there is no automated platform
to perform this process36,37, opening loopholes for the
occurrence of cross-contamination between samples and of
biological hazards to the handler, if the laboratory personnel
is not using proper personal protection equipment when
manipulating high viral load respiratory secretions28,38,39.
Some studies have been carried out to shorten the
diagnostic time using RT-PCR, and the results have shown
that the RNA extraction step can be avoided in the diagnosis
of COVID-1936,40. Grant et al.36 designed a RT-PCR to
COVID-19 that do not undergo a previous RNA extraction
step, and this procedure was compared with a high yield
automated platform (Panther fusion Hologic) that reached
that the RT-PCR with no previous RNA extraction step has
increased the performance of the technique.
To reinforce this idea, Arumugam and Wong37, dealing
with samples from influenza-suspected cases, demonstrated
that the RNA extraction step is not necessary, provided that
the patient’s nasal swab is immersed in a viral transport
medium. These results were corroborated in samples from
COVID-19 patients41,42.
In addition to the previously mentioned difficulties related
to RT-PCR, specific knowledge and specialized technical
training are required to perform these amplifications, aside
from the high costs of reagents and thermocyclers. The
occurrence of RT-PCR false-positive results are associated
with handling errors and cross-contamination of samples,
while false-negative results are related to the incorrect
sample collection, storage and processing1,10.
Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) or Enzyme-Linked
immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
EIA or ELISA are simple, fast and safe assays that
test serum or plasma samples from infected patients. The
diagnosis through ELISA is based on the detection of IgM
and IgG antibodies raised to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein
Rp3 during the initial stages of COVID-19 disease1,9,10.
Coronavirus neutralizing antibodies target the S protein
(Spike) that in turn mediates the entry of the virus into the
host cell. The S1 subunit acts on the cell binding, while the
S2 subunit acts on the fusion of the viral membrane to the
cell membrane6,43.
Okba et al.7 developed serological assays for the
detection of neutralizing antibodies, as well as antibodies
raised to the N and S proteins, as well as subunits S1 and
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from the S protein of
demonstrated that antibodies reacted with SARS-CoV-2
proteins S, S1 and RBD, in addition to indicating S1 as the
most specific antigen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. When
evaluating the other domains of the protein S, they observed
that the S2 subunit is the most conserved, playing a role
in the cross-reactivity with the S protein of MERS-CoV.
Reports in the literature suggest that false-positive
ELISA results may occur with SARS-CoV-1 infection,
as the protein N is extremely conserved among humaninfecting β-coronavirus1,10.
Although the ELISA for the detection of protein S is
more specific, in patients with mild infection, the proteins
N and RBD were more sensitive than S1, indicating the
need to detect antibodies against different antigens to avoid
false-negative results1,7.
The literature describes that IgM response to the S and
N SARS-CoV-1 proteins peaks four weeks after the onset
of symptoms, and is no longer detected three months after
the onset of symptoms, while IgG detection was detected
around the 14th day after the onset of symptoms, remaining
with 34 patients showed positivity for IgM and IgG on the
3rd week after the onset of symptoms, with a decrease of
IgM levels on the 4th week and increase of IgG from the
4th week until the 7th week after the onset of symptoms44,45.
Guo et al.46 evaluated the humoral response against
SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA technique and plasma
samples from 208 patients, 82 of whom had confirmed
diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR, aside from samples of
58 probable cases according to clinical signs and symptoms,
although RT-PCRs had been negative. The results indicated
that the mean duration of IgM and IgA antibodies was five
days, while the IgG antibodies were detected 14 days after
the onset of symptoms in those with RT-PCR-confirmed
These data showed that IgM detection by ELISA seems
to be more efficient than RT-PCR five days after the onset of
symptoms. Antibodies are known to have different temporal
dynamics, so that a combined assessment of IgG and IgM
could increase the serological diagnosis sensitivity1,45,46.
A study comparing the effectiveness of different
specificity of the Wantai SARS-CoV-2 total antibody
ELISA (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise,
Beijing, China), 93% for the Euroimmun IgA ELISA
(Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Lϋbeck,
Germany) and 96% for the Euroimmun IgG ELISA,
with sensitivities of 90%, 90% and 65%, respectively,
emphasizing the importance of combining tests raised to
different antibodies1,47.
Despite the advantages of using the ELISA technique,
according to the CDC-USA, serological tests should not be
used for diagnosing the acute phase of the disease (within
7 days from the onset of symptoms); the serological method
should be used for detecting possible previous infection
in the convalescent phase, considering the period of
14 days after the onset of symptoms; for the retrospective
assessment of outbreaks, epidemiologic studies, screening,
diagnosis of asymptomatic patients and close contacts of
confirmed cases46,48,49.
biological sample, which is an advantage of the method
considering the low viral load detected in blood samples
by RT-PCR2,31.
Some surveys have compared the GICA technique
for the detection of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 with
ELISA IgG and IgM, showing that both tests were 100%
specific, but ELISA showed 87% sensitivity, while GICA
The Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA) takes only
15 min and the analysis of 397 patients with confirmed
COVID-19 diagnosis by using the LFIA IgG and IgM
showed 88.66% sensitivity and 90.63% specificity. When
the results obtained from the analysis of blood sampled by
digital punch, venous puncture, or using serum or plasma
samples were compared, the results were consistent52.
Immunochromatographic tests are a good option for
diagnosing a large number of samples as it is fast, easy
to perform, presenting sensitive results, allowing the
identification of suspicious cases, as well as the screening
and monitoring of COVID-19 progression in populations51.
Immunochromatographic tests (rapid tests)
Microarray, a technique performed using small amounts
of sample and reagents, is based on the detection of
proteins from the specimen of interest by the recognition
of antibodies immobilized on a surface, and the recognition
is evidenced through the emission of a fluorescent signal
that is captured and analyzed by a specific equipment53,54.
In a proteomic microarray using the genome of
MN908947.3 (severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 complete genome
sequence), to build the library containing 966 peptides
as a reference, it was shown that the anti-SARS-CoV-1
antibodies can also detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins, providing
an alternative for the diagnosis of COVID-196.
Wang et al.6 screened IgG and IgM antibodies in
COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive patients via microarray and
the technique revealed that many antibodies recognized the
M, N, S, ORF1ab, ORF7a and ORF8 protein peptides. Four
immune dominant epitopes were detected in more than 80%
of the patients with confirmed diagnosis, namely: N (residue
206-210, SPARM), S (residue 816-820, SFIED) and ORF3a
(residue 136-140, KNPLL; residue 176-180, SPISE). No
antibodies were detected for E, ORF6 and ORF10.
Poh et al.55 analyzed 25 serum samples from patients
with COVID-19 and they detected immunodominant
B-cell epitopes. By depleting the antibodies directed to
the epitopes S14P5, S21P2 and S14P5 + S21P2, a reduced
ability to neutralize the SARS-CoV2-pseudovirus was
Aside from the ELISA assays, immunochromatographic
tests have also been studied in the context of COVID-19.
It is a quick test performed by the application of a drop of
the patient’s sample (whole blood, serum or plasma) and
a specific buffer on an immunochromatographic stick. By
capillary attraction, the analyte of interest (a SARS‑CoV-2
protein or peptide) binds to its specific antibody in a
reaction zone and the antigen-antibody reaction will be
evidenced by the formation of a colored band (colloidalgold presenting a red color or colloidal selenium presenting
a blue color). This reaction should always contain a test
control (band that will always appear), together with one
or two other bands; one band when the test detects total
antibodies anti‑SARS‑CoV-2 and two bands when the test
differentiates IgM and IgG antibodies50,51.
Pan et al.2 showed the effectiveness of the ColloidalGold-Immunochromatographic Assay (GICA) technique
for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 detections (Zhuhai
Livzon Diagnostics Inc, Zhuhai, China), comparing results
with those of RT-PCR. The sensitivity of GICA was 11.1%
from the 1st to the 7th day after the onset of symptoms; 92.9%
from the 8th to the 14th days and 96.8% from day 15 after
the onset of symptoms.
Whole blood samples, serum and plasma samples were
evaluated using the GICA technique, and the detection of
IgG and IgM antibodies was consistent irrespective of the
Oliveira et al.
Experiments using the full length protein S
revealed three main epitopes for the IgM antibody
and six main epitopes for IgG antibody (26-PAYTN-30;
Within protein N, two main epitopes were selected for
IgM detection (206-SPARM-210; 386-QKKQQ-390),
and eight main epitopes for IgG detection (66-FPRGQ-70;
Microarray studies strongly suggest that this is an effective
technique for mapping the antibodies profile, monitoring the
immune response and identifying candidate epitopes for the
development of diagnostic tests, vaccines and even new targets
for treatment. The results have also confirmed that the receptorbinding domain (RBD- residue 438-498) constitutes a good
candidate for the development of neutralizing antibodies due
to its action on ACE-2 receptors6,55.
