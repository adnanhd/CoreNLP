2020;4:e138e144.  The activated reninangiotensin system induces a
prothrombotic state resulting from the imbalance between coagula‐
tion and brinolysis. Angiotensin II is the central effector mole‐
cule  of the activated reninangiotensin system and is degraded by
the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 to angiotensin (17). The nov‐
el  coronavirus infection (classied as COVID‐19) is caused by the
new coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 and is characterized by an exaggerated
inammatory  response  that can lead to severe manifestations such
as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and  death  in  a
proportion  of patients, mostly elderly patients with preexisting
comorbidities. SARS‐CoV‐2 uses the angiotensin‐converting  enzyme
2  receptor to enter the target cells, resulting in activation of
the  reninangiotensin  system.  After  downregulating   the   an‐
giotensinconverting  enzyme 2, the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II
is increasingly produced and its counterregulating molecules  an‐
giotensin  (17) reduced. Angiotensin II increases thrombin forma‐
tion and impairs brinolysis. Elevated levels were strongly  asso‐
ciated  with  viral  load and lung injury in patients with severe
COVID‐19. Therefore, the complex  clinical  picture  of  patients
with severe complications of COVID‐19 is triggered by the various
effects of highly expressed angiotensin II on vasculopathy, coag‐
ulopathy,  and  inammation. Future treatment options should focus
on blocking the thrombogenic and  inammatory  properties  of  an‐
giotensin   II   in   COVID‐19   patients.   Coronavirus  disease
(COVID‐19) is a recent pandemic infection caused by an enveloped,
nonsegmented  single‐stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA)‐ coronavirus
2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). SARS‐CoV‐2 is the seventh member  of  the  coron‐
avirus1  that can cause various symptoms ranging from a mild cold
to severe respiratory diseases such as severe  acute  respiratory
syndrome  (SARS)  and  Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)
with mortality rates of 10% for SARS and 37% for MERS.2 In recent
years, two other coronary viral infections have spread and led to
severe respiratory diseases: SARS and  MERS.   SARS‐CoV  rst  ap‐
peared 18 years ago.3 During the SARS epidemic in 2002, more than
8,000 infected patients of all ages and 744 deaths were document‐
ed  in 26 countries on 5 continents. The main clinical manifesta‐
tions were upper accepted after  revision  respiratory  symptoms,
rapid  progression  of pneumonia, and approximately 20 to 30% had
to be admitted to intensive care.4 In patients over 65  years  of
age,  the mortality rate was over 50%. Of the patients treated or
dying in the intensive care unit,  11.4%  developed  disseminated
intravascular COVID‐19 is characterized by an exaggerated inamma‐
tory response that can lead to severe complications, acute respi‐
ratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis shortly after the on‐
set of symptoms.5 Thrombotic events and  coagulopathy  have  also
been  described  in COVID‐19.6 The transition from mild to severe
in patients with COVID19 can be rapid  without  predicting  symp‐
toms, and older male and obese patients with comorbidities have a
higher risk of developing severe symptoms.7

Role of Angiotensin II in Severe COVID‐19 Acute lung failure is a
pathology of many diseases, and a combination  of  antiviral  and
anti‐inammatory treatments is recommended for COVID‐19.8 Unfortu‐
nately, no specic drug or vaccine has yet been approved  for  the
treatment  of human coronavirus.  Therefore, the underlying path‐
omechanism of COVID‐19induced changes should be  investigated  to
identify  specic treatment options.  Clinical COVID‐19 Manifesta‐
tions Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, 81%  had
mild  symptoms,  14% severe, and 5% critical manifestations.9 The
case fatality rate was 2.3 and 14.8% in patients aged 80.   Older
patients and patients with comorbidities and higher body mass in‐
dex are more likely to have serious  complications  of  COVID‐19.
Severe and critical cases suffer from sepsis and ARDS, and coagu‐
lopathy occurs in 50% of cases.10 Sepsis, cytokine storm, and vi‐
ral bypassing of the cellular immune response have been described
in connection with human coronavirus  infections11,12  associated
with  neutrophilia  and  pulmonary  inltration of neutrophils and
macrophages in respiratory syndromes.13,14 Pulmonary symptoms and
pneumonia are predominant in COVID‐19.15 Pneumonia can be compli‐
cated by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which  is  a  homeo‐
static  reex  contraction of the pulmonary vascular smooth muscle
in response to low regional oxygen partial  pressure  that  redi‐
rects  blood to more oxygenated lung segments.16 In a study using
remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue drug that  inhibits  viral  RNA
polymerases  there  is  a  mortality  rate  of  18% in ventilated
COVID‐19 patients.17 Sepsis is the most  common  cause  of  acute
lung injury and ARDS.18 ARDS is characterized by diffuse alveolar
damage and is often complicated by pulmonary  hypertension.19  In
patients  with  ARDS, a subgroup of ARDS survivors develop a bro‐
pro‐ liferative response characterized by  broblast  accumulation
and  deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix compo‐
nents in the lung. The  development  of  severe  broproliferative
lung  disease  is associated with a poor prognosis with high mor‐
tality and/or prolonged  ventilator  dependence.20  All  patients
with severe complications experienced extrapulmonary symptoms and
organ injuries. In a multivariable  analysis  comparing  clinical
and  laboratory parameters of 137 surviving patients from 54 non‐
survivors, death occurred median on  the  18th  day  of  hospital
treatment  after mechanical ventilation for 14.5 days.10 In three
patients an attempt was made to perform  extracorporeal  membrane
oxygenation.  All  54 deceased patients developed sepsis (100 vs.
42% of survivors), 53 patients suffered from respiratory  failure
(98  vs. 36%), 50 patients suffered from ARDS (93 vs. 7%), 28 pa‐
tients suffered from heart failure (52 vs. 12%), and 38  patients
suffered from septic shock (70 vs. 0%). The rate of patients with
organ injury was signicantly higher in patients with severe  out‐
come.  Of  54  patients,  32  patients had a heart injury, 25 had
heart failure, and 27 had a kidney  injury.   In  China,  several
studies investigated the clinical course of COVID‐19, differenti‐
ating between severe and nonsevere outcome and collecting data on
organ injury. In 6 studies, the clinical course of 1,841 patients
was investigated, 21% of whom developed a severe manifestation of
the  disease.7,10,12,2123 Median age ranged from 49 to 71.5 years
and was up to 28.5 years older than in  patients  with  nonsevere
course. Male patients were more affected by severe manifestations
from 57.8 to 78%. All patients with severe manifestations had or‐
gan injuries, up to 55% heart injuries Angiotensin‐converting en‐
zyme 2 (ACE2) is critical for heart function. Angiotensin II (Ang
II)  infusions  in mice resulted in increased blood pressure, my‐
ocardial hypertrophy, and brosis, whereas these effects could  be
counteracted with recombinant human ACE2.24 Loss of ACE2 can fur‐
ther exacerbate cardiac damage.25 Male sex in severe Zhou et al10

Pathological Role of Angiotensin II in Severe COVID‐19 Myocardial
infarction  appears  to  be an important complication of the dis‐
ease, which, according to Chen et al, was also found in  the  au‐
topsy  of a 53‐year‐old female patient.5 In a meta‐analysis, car‐
diac troponin I levels are signicantly increased in patients with
severe  COVID‐19  infection  compared  with  patients with milder
forms of the disease.26 Cardiac injury has been shown in a cross‐
sectional  study  with 150 patients included, 126 mild and 24 se‐
vere cases5 and has been conrmed as common condition among hospi‐
talized  patients associated with higher risk of in‐hospital mor‐
tality.27 Of a total of 416 patients, 19.7%  had  cardiac  injury
and highly signicant elevated levels of high‐sensitive troponin I
levels.  The mortality of these patients was  signicantly  higher
with  51.2% than those without cardiac injury (4.5%).  Laboratory
and imaging ndings suggest an increased risk of thrombotic events
in  patients with COVID‐19 infection, but the incidence of throm‐
bosis in patients with COVID‐19 has not been determined.   Coagu‐
lopathy  has been described in up to 50% of severe manifestations
of COVID‐19. It has been shown that increased  D‐dimers  measured
at   hospital   admission   can  predict  the  severe  course  of
COVID‐19.10 D‐dimer derives from  the  cleavage  of  cross‐linked
brin  and  reects  both  thrombin  production  and  activation of
brinolysis. Besides the known variability in healthy subjects and
its tendency to increase with age, there is an association of in‐
creased D‐dimer levels and brin degradation  products  under  all
conditions with an activated coagulation system, such as thrombo‐
sis, infection, or malignancy.28 A  large  study  included  1,099
COVID positive patients from 552 hospitals in China. D‐dimer lev‐
els above the threshold of 0.5 g/L were detected in 46.4% of  pa‐
tients;  60% among them developed severe manifestations. In these
patients, Ddimer levels were fourfold  increased  at  2.12  ug/mL
(0.775.27)   compared   with   nonsevere  patients  (0.61  ug/mL,
0.351.29).  Interestingly, none of the nonsevere patients had  D‐
dimer levels increasing more than three times at admission.7 In a
study of 184 critically ill patients with COVID‐19 from  3  Dutch
hospitals, there was a 31% incidence of thrombosis instead of the
use of standard doses of thromboprophylaxis  with  low  molecular
weight  heparin.  The majority of patients suffered from lung em‐
bolism, but stroke  also  occurred  in  three  In  addition,  mi‐
crothrombosis was described in a case series of four autopsies of
COVID‐19 infected patients from New Orleans with sudden  respira‐
tory decompensation. The autopsy ndings showed small vessels with
thromboembolism and small thrombi together with  scattered  areas
of  diffuse  alveolar  damage.  These ndings usually worsened the
course of the disease and could hardly be diagnosed  early.   The
D‐dimers found at the time of death were elevated in only two pa‐
tients, which shows that microthrombosis does not usually lead to
generalized coagulation activation.30 The ReninAngiotensin System
The reninangiotensin system (RAS) was rst described more than  40
years  ago and has led to a broader understanding of cardiovascu‐
lar pathophysiology.31 The RAS is known TH Open for its  role  in
the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and vascu‐
lar remodeling.32 Continuous basic and clinical research has  en‐
abled  signicant  advances in therapy and developed the treatment
of hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction as well  as  se‐
vere  heart failure.  Renin is released by the kidney in response
to renal hypoperfusion, reduced sodium  intake,  and  sympathetic
activation.  A cascade of proteolytic reactions leads to the for‐
mation of Ang peptides with different functions.  The  ACE  is  a
zinc‐dependent  peptidase responsible for the conversion of Ang I
into vasoconstrictive Ang II. ACE2 counteracts  the  activity  of
ACE  by  reducing  the  amount  of  Ang II, increasing Ang,17 and
cleaving Ang I to Ang19 and thereby attenuating  the  effects  of
Ang  II. The RAS produces opposite effects and Ang17 directly an‐
tagonizes the effects of Ang II and mediates vasodilatory and an‐
tiproliferative  effects because it induces the release of nitric
oxide and prostaglandin I2 after stimulation of  the  endothelial
AT2  receptor.33,34  ACE2  is expressed predominantly by vascular
endothelial cells of the lung, but also of extrapulmonary tissue,
heart,  nervous  system,  intestine,  kidneys, blood vessels, and
muscles on cell surfaces.35,36 In addition,  ACE2  has  functions
that  are  independent  of RAS. In vitro and in vivo studies have
shown that ACE2 acts as a functional SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor as  well
as  the  transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which is required
for host cell entry and subsequent viral  replication.37  Remark‐
ably,  the  SARS‐CoV‐2 protein recognizes human ACE2 with an even
higher binding afnity than the spike of  SARS‐CoV.38  Preclinical
studies  have  shown that after binding of SARS‐CoV to its recep‐
tor, ACE2 activates RAS leading to downregulation of the  expres‐
sion  of  ACE2,  which in turn results in excessive production of
Ang II.3942 Therefore, ACE2 plays a dual role in  COVID‐19:  Ini‐
tially,  it acts as a receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry, then, in the
context of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, ACE2 is downregulated, which in‐
creases Ang II.  The Role of Angiotensin II Ang II is the central
effector molecule of activated RAS.  Elevated levels  of  Ang  II
have been reported mostly in patients with hypertension and heart
failure, indicating the benet of RAS inhibitors.43 There are  two
Ang II receptors, type 1 and type 2, which indicate the effect of
RAS inhibitors.43 Most cardiovascular effects of Ang II  are  at‐
tributed  to  the type 1 receptor.  Notably, Ang II is one of the
most potent vasopressors known when linked to its type 1 Ang  re‐
ceptor.  The vasopressor effects of Ang II were investigated in a
multinational,   double‐blind,   randomized   controlled    trial
(ATHOS‐3)  in  163 patients with vasodilatory shock.44 Ang II ef‐
fectively raised blood pressure  in  patients  with  vasodilatory
shock who did not respond to high doses of conventional vasopres‐
sors.  However, a high rate of thrombosis was observed  in  12.9%
of  patients and the use of thromboprophylaxis was recommended.45
Interestingly, skin problems possibly  caused  by  thrombosis  of
small  vessels  were  also  observed.   Pathological  Role of An‐
giotensin II in Severe COVID‐19 There is evidence for the  impor‐
tant role of Ang II in vascular cell growth and tissue remodeling
after hypertension, vascular injury, heart failure,  and  athero‐
sclerosis.46,47  Recently, Ang II has been shown to stimulate the
production of pulmonary broblast procollagen via the AT1 receptor
in lung injury.48 In addition, Ang II promotes the growth of vas‐
cular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which induces cellular  hyper‐
trophy in the pathology of hypertension and Ang II contributes to
endothelial dysfunction, the development of arteriosclerosis, and
microvascular  thrombosis.   Ang II stimulates tissue factor (TF)
expression both in vitro and in vivo.49 TF is  the  physiological
initiator  of blood coagulation and as a consequence of its acti‐
vation, TF becomes dominant over TF pathway inhibitor,  resulting
in  prothrombotic  endothelium.  In  addition,  Ang II stimulates
platelet‐derived growth factor production and increases  platelet
aggregation. Arterial thrombotic events such as stroke or myocar‐
dial infarction are associated with increased  platelet  aggrega‐
tion.50 key players in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, in‐
ammation, coagulation, and angiogenesis  are  increased  in  many
age‐related  vascular  diseases  such as coronary artery disease,
but also stimulated by Ang II.51 It has also been shown that  Ang
II infusion leads to abnormal inammatory and thrombotic reactions
in the microcirculation. In hypertensive rats, Ang II accelerates
arterial thrombosis of the carotid artery via the AT1 receptor.52
The prothrombogenic effects are not restricted to large arteries.
There  is also accelerated microvascular thrombosis in arterioles
and to a lesser extent in venules after Ang II Clinical data also
support  the role of Ang II in brinolysis.  Plasminogen activator
inhibitor 1 (PAI‐1) is the major inhibitor of the brinolytic sys‐
tem  and  elevated  levels  have been found to be associated with
coronary artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, and  malignancy.54
Mature  fat  cells  are an important source of PAI‐1, and its ex‐
pression correlates with visceral fat mass.  In  vitro  and  vivo
studies  have shown that Ang II stimulates the expression and re‐
lease of PAI‐1. Ang II also stimulates the  expression  of  PAI‐1
messenger  RNA  (mRNA)  in endothelial cells and increases plasma
PAI‐1 levels in a dose‐dependent manner. The infusion of  Ang  II
in healthy volunteers led to a signicant increase in PAI‐1 In the
HEART study, PAI‐1 concentrations were signicantly lower when ad‐
ministering both ramipril and captopril,56 both of which can sup‐
press the formation of Ang II in adipose tissue.54  In  addition,
inhalation  of plasminogen, whose conversion to plasmin is inhib‐
ited by PAI‐1, improves lung lesions and  hypoxemia  in  patients
with  COVID‐19.57  There is an association between activated RAS,
increased Ang II, and inammatory cytokine expression and  activa‐
tion.   Ang  II  has  proinammatory properties, including the in‐
crease of interleukin (IL)‐6, which was demonstrated after  infu‐
sion  of  Ang  II  in healthy controls.58 Furthermore, Ang II has
been shown to induce IL‐6 transcription in VSMC.59 In  VSMC,  the
expression  of  IL‐6  could be induced by Ang II,60 which may ex‐
plain the underlying mechanism in the progression of  Ang  II‐in‐
duced  atherosclerosis.   IL‐6 is a multifunctional cytokine that
mediates the proliferation of B‐lymphocytes during antibody  syn‐
thesis.   Ang  II stimulates the release of IL‐6, contributing to
cytokine storm and poorer outcomes in patients  with  COVID‐19.59
The function of ACE2 has also been demonstrated in an ACE2 knock‐
out mouse model: The loss of ACE2 expression preceded acute  lung
damage  in  various models. ACE2 knockout mice showed more severe
lung damage caused by  increased  hydrostatic  pressure,  reduced
perfusion, and severe pulmonary edema.41 Administration of recom‐
binant ACE2 protects the lungs from severe  lung  damage.  Conse‐
quently,  Ang  II  is directly associated with lung tissue damage
and ACE2 is inversely associated with lung tissue damage.   Organ
damage  to the lung, heart, and kidney is a major cause of severe
clinical manifestations in COVID patients.  Already in 2005, ACE2
was  shown  to protect the mouse lungs from ARDS in ACE2 knockout
mice. In particular, the injection of SARS‐CoV spikes  into  mice
exacerbates  acute  lung failure in vivo, which can be attenuated
by blocking the reninangiotensin  signaling  pathway,  suggesting
that  activation  of  pulmonary  RAS inuences the pathogenesis of
ARDS and SARS.39,41 In autopsies of patients who died from  SARS,
35%  of  heart  samples showed the presence of SARSCoV associated
with reduced ACE2 expression.61 Remarkably,  the  unbalanced  RAS
was  found in COVID‐19 patients. In an investigation of epidemio‐
logical, clinical, laboratory chemical, and radiological  charac‐
teristics and potential biomarkers to predict disease severity in
2019nCoV‐infected patients in Shenzhen,  Ang  II  levels  in  the
plasma  sample  of  2019‐nCoV‐infected  patients were shown to be
signicantly elevated and linearly associated with viral load  and
lung  damage  in  critically ill patients.62 clinical symptoms of
COVID‐19 patients. The complex clinical picture of patients  with
severe complications of COVID19 is triggered by the different ef‐
fects of highly expressed Ang II on  vasculopathy,  coagulopathy,
and inammation.  Treatment Options of Angiotension 2Related Clin‐
ical Symptoms It could be shown that patients with COVID‐19  have
an  unbalanced RAS with highly expressed Ang levels. In addition,
the presence of comorbidities such as  arterial  hypertension  is
signicantly  associated with a worse outcome. Of a total of 1,430
patients in 3 studies, hypertension was common in up  to  48%  of
patients and there were signicantly more severe manifestations in
36 to 48% of patients compared with severe manifestations  in  14
to  24%  of  patients  The presence of hypertension is associated
with signicantly higher mortality. The odds ratio  for  mortality
in  hypertension  is  between  1.70  (0.923.13)12 and 3.05 (1.6 ‐
5.9).10 However, the data were not adjusted to other risk TH Open

come of patients with hypertension versus of patients with no hy‐
pertension factors and it  became  not  clear  from  the  studies
whether  the  hypertension was previously known or was only diag‐
nosed during the hospital stay and whether treatment,  for  exam‐
ple,  with  RAS‐inhibiting  drugs,  was administered.  Therefore,
RAS‐inhibiting drugs, such  as  ACE  inhibitors  (ACEIs)  or  an‐
giotensin  receptor  blockers (ARBs), may be used in COVID‐19‐in‐
fected patients to treat hypertension and  other  Ang  II‐related
complications.  A  preclinical study showed that ARB drugs, espe‐
cially losartan, are effective in  relieving  acute  lung  injury
caused by SARS‐CoV in mice.62 However, ACEI and ARB have shown an
increase in ACE2 expression (in heart tissue) in animal models.63
There  is  concern that a possible higher expression of pulmonary
membrane‐bound ACE2 (which has not been conrmed to date) may lead
to  easier entry of the virus into respiratory cells when RAS‐in‐
hibiting drugs are taken.  On the other hand, both ACEI  (lisino‐
pril)  and  ARB  (losartan) can upregulate cardiac ACE2 mRNA by a
factor of 3 to 4. In an animal model, the ACEI enalapril  attenu‐
ated the downregulation of cardiac ACE2 after myocardial There is
a clear benet of ACEI and ARB in reducing thrombotic  effects  in
hypertensive patients.66,67 Protection against severe lung damage
could also be achieved by administering  recombinant  ACE2.  ACE2
knockout  mice showed more severe lung damage caused by increased
hydrostatic pressure, reduced  perfusion,  and  severe  pulmonary
edema.41  Administration  of  recombinant ACE2 protects the lungs
from severe lung damage. Consequently, Ang II is TH Open directly
associated  with lung tissue damage and ACE2 is inversely associ‐
ated with lung tissue damage.  Recently, it could be  shown  that
human  recombinant  soluble  ACE2 can block early stages of SARS‐
CoV‐2 infections68 and could in the future also be used to  treat
COVID‐19  patients,  which is currently being tested in a phase 2
clinical Currently, numerous drugs are studied in  clinical  tri‐
als.  A  small cohort of critically ill patients was treated with
remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral  RNA  poly‐
merases,  and a clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 pa‐
tients (68%).17 Randomized controlled trials are ongoing and will
soon provide more evidence of the safety and efcacy of remdesivir
for Covid‐19.  Finally, considering COVID‐19  as  a  procoagulant
disease,  prophylactic  anticoagulation with low molecular weight
heparin should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent throm‐
botic  events  and to counteract the proinammatory inuence of cy‐
tokines.69 The transition from mild to severe symptoms can  occur
rapidly in patients with COVID‐19 without predicting signals, and
older male and obese patients with comorbidities  have  a  higher
risk  of  developing severe symptoms.  The RAS plays an important
role in COVID‐19. ACE2 acts as  functional  SARS‐CoV‐2  receptor,
which  leads  to a downregulation of ACE2 and a higher expression
of Ang II. ACE2 is Pathological Role of Angiotensin II in  Severe
COVID‐19 predominantly expressed by vascular endothelial cells of
the lung, but also in extrapulmonary tissue, heart, nervous  sys‐
tem,  intestine, kidneys, blood vessels, and muscles on cell sur‐
faces, which may explain the multiorgan dysfunction  observed  in
patients with COVID‐19.  The complex clinical picture of patients
with severe complications of COVID‐19 includes  pneumonia,  ARDS,
sepsis,  coagulopathy,  high rate of thrombosis, and organ damage
and is triggered by various effects of highly expressed Ang II on
vasculopathy,  coagulopathy,  and inammation.  The combination of
numerous pathophysiological changes caused by Ang II in  COVID‐19
could  explain  the  rapid development of severe patients and why
older and  obese  patients  are  particularly  affected.   Future
treatment  options  should focus on blocking the thrombogenic and
inammatory properties of Ang II in COVID‐19 patients.  14 Kim ES,
