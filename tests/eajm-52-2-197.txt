[2019‐nCoV;  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  2
(SARS‐CoV‐2)]  was  first  detected in Wuhan, China at the end of
2019. In current status, spread of COVID‐19  in  person‐to‐person
could  be  caused  mainly by respiratory droplets, which leads to
the spread of the influenza virus in both  community  and  clini‐
cians. Thus, in order to reduce the risk of that, the urgent man‐
agement strategies against COVID‐19 are  to  block  transmission,
isolation,  protection,  and  using drug or vaccine updated on an
ongoing basis. unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines still has  yet
been allowed to treat patients with COVID‐19, so the rapid detec‐
tion of effective intercessions against COVID‐19 is seemed  a  of
COVID‐19,  the  influence  of droplets travel in person‐to‐person
transmission and the effect of wearing  masks  in  the  infection
prevention  of  influenza virus, as well as understanding its ad‐
vantage and role in the coronavirus infection  prevention.   Key‐

coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID‐19) outbreak is one of the hot
issues around the world today. As known, the influenza virus (in‐
fluenza  A  virus  subtype  H1N1 (H1N1), severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), Middle East  respiratory  syndrome  (MERS),  and
COVID‐19  viruses)  outbreak is a threat to human health, as well
as a major challenge for both community and clinicians [1‐4]. For
example,  health care workers (HCWs) can initially be at risk and
get infected from examining and treating patients with a respira‐
tory  infection  [5] and then become indiscreet carriers to other
patients, family members, and the community if they do not  regu‐
larly  wash  their  hands or take other infection‐preventive mea‐
sures. In addition, owing to shortages in the availability of an‐
tiviral  medicine and delays in drug or vaccine development, res‐
piratory protection is one of the key  non‐pharmaceutical  inter‐
ventions  for  protection  of  both  community and clinicians. As
such, it is truly necessary for each individual in the  community
and for clinicians to use personal respiratory protective methods
to prevent infection of the influenza virus. Therefore,  current‐
ly, handwashing and wearing masks are one of the ways of prevent‐
ing infection of the influenza virus. However,  currently,  there
are gaps in the knowledge about the prevention of influenza virus
by wearing masks (cloth masks, medical  masks,  N95  respirators,
and  surgical  masks).  Hence,  this  paper aims to introduce the
characteristics of COVID‐19, the influence of droplet  travel  in
person‐to‐person transmission, and the effect of wearing masks in
COVID‐19 infection Characteristics of COVID‐19 To date, the emer‐
gence  and  rapid transmission of COVID‐19 from patients with se‐
vere pneumonia in Wuhan, China, has become a global  health  con‐
cern [6‐9]. The features of COVID‐19 are similar to those of SARS
(or MERS), which is known as a single‐stranded RNA  b‐coronavirus
genome  with enveloping and positive‐sense, ranging from 26 to 32
kilobases in length [10], as  well  as  encoding  non‐structural,
structural, and accessory proteins. Fever, fatigue, and dry cough
are considered symptoms of COVID‐19. Sometimes, there are  a  few
patients  with  mild 198  Vo et al. Wearing Masks in COVID‐19 In‐
fection Prevention To  further  understand  its  characteristics,
Huang  et  al.  [9]  and  Chan  et al. [14] showed the multifocal
ground‐glass changes in the chest and 1) that are typical of  vi‐
ral pneumonia. One of the disease development features is the bi‐
lateral multiple lobular and sub segmental areas of consolidation
found in the chest CT scan. Besides, in CT scan images, the lungs
of older patients were further diffused and  found  to  be  wider
than  those  of  the younger patients [11, 14]. According to some
references for the source of the COVID‐19 emergence, most of  the
infected patients were associated with the seafood wholesale mar‐
ket in Wuhan, China [9], or the COVID‐19  virus  penetrated  into
the  market  place before it spread from there [15]; however, the
spread of  COVID‐19  remains  largely  unknown.  Transmission  of
COVID‐19  could  be  airborne or human‐to‐human contact; however,
both aerosol and fecal‐oral  transmission  still  remain  unclear
[13].  To  date,  critical  public  health measures to reduce the
transmission of COVID‐19 include quarantine both in community and
clinicians,  as  well  as timely diagnosis (through testing kits,
etc.) and strict participation to prevent the spread of the virus
in  health  care settings [16]. Furthermore, lessons from the in‐
fluenza virus (H1N1, SARS‐CoV, and MERS‐CoV) outbreak  also  sup‐
port  to effectively prepare for COVID‐19 outbreak [17].  Wearing
Masks to Prevent COVID‐19 Infection Influence of  droplet  travel
in  person‐toperson  transmission As known, reducing transmission
of the influenza virus in both community and clinicians  may  not
only  help  support them but also prevent person‐to‐person trans‐
mission during an influenza virus pandemic. For other  protective
strategies,  drugs  or vaccines may be limited in permission from
[14] Droplet diameter (m) Arylesterase (ARE) activity could be  a
useful  marker in COPD.  PON1 RR phenotype was common in COPD and
this result is consistent with PON1  genotype  studies  in  COPD.
Smoking  and RR phenotype can be defined independent determinants
relation with COPD.  Main Points availability. Thus, it is  truly
necessary  for  clearly  understanding  the  influence of droplet
travel in person‐to‐person transmission to support  the  COVID‐19
infection  prevention. Transmission of COVID‐19 could be airborne
or through contact, especially large droplets and airborne routes
are credited to person‐to‐person transmission, which could be the
cause of a large number of influenza infections, as well as trav‐
el of droplets, which involves traveling of droplet‐ symptoms and
then patients gradually start experiencing aches,  nasal  conges‐
tion,  runny  nose,  sore throat, or diarrhea. Several people who
are infected do not develop any symptoms;  in  particular,  older
adults  and  people  with  underlying medical diseases (diabetes,
heart problems, or high blood pressure) are prone  to  experience
serious  symptoms,  especially those with a history of close con‐
tact with COVID‐19‐infected patients and a history of  travel  to
Wuhan,  China.   The period of incubation is generally 37 days of
14 days [11]. For example, a 65‐year‐old Chinese man was admitted
to  Cho  Ray  Hospital  in  Ho  Chi Minh City, Vietnam [12] and a
35‐yearold man was referred to an  urgent  care  clinic  in  Sno‐
homish, Washington, USA [13], both had cough and fever during the
last four days of the incubatory period.  Eurasian  J  Med  2020;

reach Eurasian J Med 2020; 52(2): 197‐201 borne diseases that can
transmit from one person to another. A typical example for travel
of droplets is sneezing, which is seen as an exhalation mode with
common respiratory symptoms; in  particular,  respiratory  infec‐
tious  symptoms  could  create mucus and stimulate various nerves
within the nasal mucous membranes and lead to a sneeze.  However,
the  mechanism of the biological dynamics of a sneeze is a little
different from that of other respiratory activities. According to
some  references,  the velocity of the exhaled air in sneezing is
much larger than that of breathing and coughing [18‐20], and  the
created total number of droplets during the sneeze is also larger
than that of other respiratory activities [21]; one can refer  to
some  references of the distribution of size of droplets produced
by a cough [22‐24], a sneeze [25‐27], speech [24, 28, 29], and  a
breath  [24, 30‐33], and the concentration and number of droplets
[34‐36].  considered to be on the basis of relative humidity, air
speed,  and  respiratory jets, which could be the result of their
evaporation and movement from expulsion during respiratory activ‐
ities.  Specifically,  Xie  et al. [37] calculated both lifetimes
and size changes of a droplet, as well as how  far  the  droplets
travel.  The  results  showed  that the droplets with the largest
size possible  completely  evaporate  before  falling  2  m  away
(60‐100  m);  these  droplets are moved further (i.e., >6 m [n=50
ms‐1] in sneezing, >2 m [n=10 ms‐1] in coughing, and  <1  m  [n=1
ms‐1]  in  breathing). It is really important to develop measures
of effective engineering control for the prevention of respirato‐
ry  infectious symptoms, as well as to explore the person‐to‐per‐
son transmission mechanisms involving travel of droplets  of  in‐
fectious  diseases. The results suggested that the rapid evapora‐
tion of small droplets and the quick falling of  larger  droplets
on  the  ground  or on surfaces, as well as horizontally deported
large droplets could also  travel  a  long  distance.   Moreover,
these  droplets  could  be suspended in the air with low relative
humidity conditions, which can lead to the increase in the possi‐
bility  of  subsequent  inhalation. Thus, an understanding of the
travel of droplets has been significant for  developing  measures
of  effective  engineering  control in the prevention of COVID‐19
infection and  in  exploring  the  person‐to‐person  transmission
mechanisms  of infectious diseases.  However, respiratory protec‐
tion demonstrates that aerial transmission is one of the  assumed
methods  of transmission of the influenza virus [39]. The results
of trials confirmed that only large droplets are discovered close
to  the pa‐ Vo et al. Wearing Masks in COVID‐19 Infection Preven‐
tion sizes could be found at short distances  from  the  patient,
and aerosolized transmission could also occur at a close distance
[41].  Finally, the main transmission of COVID‐19 is  related  to
the  droplets  created  when a person breathes, talks, coughs, or
sneezes. When the droplets travel, they get suspended in the  air
and  quickly  fall on the ground or on surfaces.  Besides, anyone
can become infected with the virus because of breathing within  1
m  of  personto‐person  distance as well as touching a contagious
surface followed by touching eyes, nose, or mouth without washing
hands.   Effect  of Wearing Masks in COVID‐19 Infection There are
some randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), which are  not
only  based  on  handwashing  [43‐45]  but  also on wearing masks
(cloth masks, medical masks, N95 respirators, and surgical masks)
both  in community and clinicians [46‐49]; however, the trials of
wearing masks for respiratory protection are limited, and the ef‐
fect of wearing masks in the COVID‐19 infection prevention is not
yet clearly understood.  As known, the influenza spread could oc‐
cur  by could be inhaled with a range of 0.1‐100 m [50‐55]; thus,
the personal respiratory protective equipment is really needed to
prevent  or limit the influenza virus outbreak. Besides, N95 res‐
pirators could be unavailable in many countries at  short  notice
of  a  pandemic;  therefore,  it is truly important to understand
clearly the relative effectiveness of personal  respiratory  pro‐
tective equipment. So far, there are a few comparative studies of
personal respiratory protective equipment [46,47] and  data  com‐
paring  the  surgical  mask  with  the  N95 respirator among HCWs
[56,57]. Although N95 respirators are not regularly suggested for
seasonal influenza, they could play a role in personal protection
against the influenza  virus  pandemic  (H1N1,  SARS,  MERS,  and
COVID‐19 viruses).  The result indicates that HCWs wearing surgi‐
cal masks are not prone to  experience  influenza  compared  with
those  wearing  N95  respirators while treating patients with in‐
fluenza. There are trials for personal protection against  respi‐
ratory  infections, for example, MacIntyre et al.  [58] performed
RCTs to investigate the effect of medical masks and N95  respira‐
tors,  proving  that N95 respirators provided superior protection
against infections of droplet transmission.  Besides,  to  ensure
safety and health of HCWs, the superiority of respirators in pre‐
venting re‐ spiratory infections are also included  in  infection
control  guidelines.  Currently,  there are only five of a common
ground around the effect of two kinds of masks (medical masks and
N95  respirators)  for  HCWs  against influenza [48, 59‐62].  Al‐
though N95 respirators have been displayed as superior than medi‐
cal  masks  in  preventing influenza respiratory infection, there
are still no studies that examined the  laboratory‐confirmed  in‐
fluenza.  In  other smaller trials, it was found that there is no
increase in respiratory diseases between HCWs while wearing medi‐
cal  masks  [59]. Besides, there is only one small‐scale RCT that
compared medical masks and N95 respirators in HCWs [48], conclud‐
ing that there is no difference, but there is a lack of an arm of
controlling. Although medical masks were not designed to  provide
respiratory  protection  [63],  with lower filtration efficiency,
they were designed specifically for personal  protection  [6466].
Moreover,  they  were designed to prevent wound contamination for
the surgeon [67‐69].  Thus, these large‐scale RCTs were also  un‐
able  to  demonstrate  any  differences  between the two kinds of
masks in the influenza infection [60, 61].  A recently  conducted
trial  identified the effect of cloth masks compared with medical
masks, concluding that cloth masks could increase the risk of in‐
fection in HCWs [62]. In addition, the period of wearing the dis‐
posable mask, extent to which it protects, and invention of reus‐
able masks should be researched further.  Overall, in the current
COVID‐19 outbreak, infection of  the  influenza  virus.  However,
there  are  several  important limitations of the RCTs, including
the lack of performed measures during the study period  and  non‐
collection  of  data  regarding  the frequency of device changing
[70].  If everyone wears masks, we cannot  differentiate  between
those  who  are  unwell by observing that they are wearing masks.
Recently, the World Health  Organization  suggested  that  people
with  respiratory  symptoms  and  those  who care for people with
symptoms should wear masks [71]. It is truly  important  to  wear
and  remove  masks correctly to reduce the personto‐person trans‐
mission of COVID‐19 as well as to ensure correct fit of the  mask
so that it covers the nose and mouth properly [72, 73]. We should
use soap with water (or warm water) or hand sanitizer  for  hand‐
washing,  and make sure that the mask covers the nose, mouth, and
chin there are no gaps, and we should avoid touching or adjusting
the masks during use. Similar measures are taken while removing a
mask, with few 200  Vo et al. Wearing Masks in COVID‐19 Infection
Prevention  differences:  untie  the bottom tie of the mask, then
remove top tie and remove the mask from the face; the  mask  must
be discarded immediately and cannot be reused. Handwashing is the
final step. Moreover, older adults  and  people  with  underlying
medical  conditions  are recommended to wear masks, if available.
In summary, to develop effective measures of prevention  to  con‐
trol  infectious diseases in both community and clinicians, it is
necessary to understand clearly the knowledge about prevention of
the  influenza  virus. Because the COVID‐19 pandemic is worsening
by the hour, individuals need to rapidly respond  to  this  risk.
Washing  hands  diligently,  covering coughs, and avoiding crowds
and close contact are measures to avoid the risks of transmission
in  the  community.  Wearing masks routinely is especially recom‐
mended for all individuals to prevent exposure in  the  community
before  the  vaccine is invented. Therefore, isolation, handwash‐
ing, and preventing the spread of the  virus  are  the  practical
strategies  used  to  tackle the spread of COVID‐19. In addition,
respiratory protection by wearing masks is one of the methods  to
prevent infection of the influenza virus; however, trials related
to COVID‐19 are limited. In addition, the period of  wearing  the
disposable mask, the level of protection of masks, and the inven‐
tion of reusable masks should be researched further.  Ethics Com‐
