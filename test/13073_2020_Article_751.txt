Background: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has caused a major epidemic worldwide; however, much is yet
to be known about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus partly due to the scarcity of full-length SARS-CoV-2
(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) genomes reported. One reason is that the challenges underneath
sequencing SARS-CoV-2 directly from clinical samples have not been completely tackled, i.e., sequencing samples
with low viral load often results in insufficient viral reads for analyses.
Methods: We applied a novel multiplex PCR amplicon (amplicon)-based and hybrid capture (capture)-based
sequencing, as well as ultra-high-throughput metatranscriptomic (meta) sequencing in retrieving complete
genomes, inter-individual and intra-individual variations of SARS-CoV-2 from serials dilutions of a cultured isolate,
and eight clinical samples covering a range of sample types and viral loads. We also examined and compared the
sensitivity, accuracy, and other characteristics of these approaches in a comprehensive manner.

Results: We demonstrated that both amplicon and capture methods efficiently enriched SARS-CoV-2 content from
clinical samples, while the enrichment efficiency of amplicon outran that of capture in more challenging samples.
We found that capture was not as accurate as meta and amplicon in identifying between-sample variations,
whereas amplicon method was not as accurate as the other two in investigating within-sample variations,
heavily rely on intra-host dynamics. We illustrated that meta uncovered rich genetic information in the clinical
samples besides SARS-CoV-2, providing references for clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Taken all factors above
and cost-effectiveness into consideration, we proposed guidance for how to choose sequencing strategy for SARSCoV-2 under different situations.
Conclusions: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work systematically investigating inter- and intraindividual variations of SARS-CoV-2 using amplicon- and capture-based whole-genome sequencing, as well as the
first comparative study among multiple approaches. Our work offers practical solutions for genome sequencing and
analyses of SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses.

As of 14 March 2020, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has surpassed severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
in every aspect, infecting over 140,000 people in more
than 110 countries, with a mortality of over 5000 [1]. So
far, coronaviruses have caused three major epidemics in
the past two decades, posing a great challenge to global
health and economy. Massively parallel sequencing
(MPS) of viral genomes has demonstrated enormous
capacity as a powerful tool to study emerging infectious
diseases, such as SARS, MERS, Zika, and Ebola, in tracing the outbreak origin and drivers, tracking transmission chains, mapping the spread, and monitoring the
evolution of the etiological agents [27]. Though by 14
March 2020, fewer than 500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were
GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb), NCBI GenBank, and
the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID), and much remains unknown about the
epidemiology and evolution of the virus. One possible
samples with low virus abundance.
The first teams obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequences through metatranscriptomic MPS, supplemented by PCR and Sanger sequencing of a combination
of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) and culture [8
10] or from BALF directly [11]. Experience from studying SARS-CoV showed that BALF from the lower respiratory tract was an ideal sample type with higher viral
load [12]. However, BALF was not routinely collected
from every patient, and human airway epithelial (HAE)
cell culture is very labor-intensive and time-consuming,
taking 4 to 6 weeks [9, 13]. Chan et al. managed to get
the whole-genome sequences through metatranscriptomic sequencing with Oxford Nanopore platform supplemented by Sanger sequencing from both
whole-genome sequence using oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens through Sanger and metatranscriptomic sequencing with both Illumina and MinIon
[15]. To date, multiplex PCR-based or hybrid capturebased whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, as well
as comparative studies between different approaches,
Besides inter-individual variations, dissecting intraindividual dynamics of viruses also largely promotes our
understanding of virus-host interactions, viral evolution,
and transmission as demonstrated for Ebola, Zika, Influenza, etc. [5, 1618]. The analyses of intra-individual
single nucleotide variations (iSNVs) and its allele frequency have also contributed to anti-viral therapy and
drug resistance, e.g., to reveal highly conserved genes
during the outbreak that potentially serve as ideal therapeutic targets [17, 19]. However, it is challenging to accurately detect iSNVs from clinical samples, especially
when the samples are subjected to extra steps of enrichment and amplification.
Therefore, we aim to comprehensively compare the
sensitivity, inter-individual (variant) and intra-individual
(iSNV) accuracy, and other general features of different
approaches by systematically utilizing ultra-highthroughput metatranscriptomic, hybrid capture-based,
and amplicon-based sequencing approaches to obtain
genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 from serial

dilutions of a cultured isolate and directly from clinical
samples. We present a reasonable sequencing strategy
that fits into different scenarios and estimate the
minimal amount of sequencing data for downstream
SARS-CoV-2 genome analyses. Our study offers practical solutions to facilitate the studies of SARS-CoV-2
and other emerging viruses in the future and would
promote extensive genomic sequencing and analyses of
SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses, which would
in turn contribute to real-time virus surveillance and
managing viral outbreaks. Benefiting from our experimental workflows and bioinformatic pipelines, BGI

Clinical specimens (including throat swab, nasal swab,
anal swab, and sputum) were obtained from confirmed
COVID-19 cases at the First Affiliated Hospital of
Academy of Military Medical Science (AMMS) and subjected to 10-fold serial dilutions. Virus isolation and
RNA extraction were done in a biosafety level (BSL) 2+
laboratory with BSL-3 protection. Total RNA was
extracted directly from the clinical specimens without
inactivating the virus with QiAamp RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Heiden, Germany) following the manufacturers
instructions without modification. Real-time reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) targeting RdRp gene and
N gene of SARS-CoV-2 was used to detect and quantify
the viral RNA within clinical samples and serial dilutions
of the cultured isolate using the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic
Acid Detection Kit following the manufactures protocol
(Geneodx, Shanghai, China, and BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China).
A hybrid capture technique was used to enrich SARS-CoV2-specific content from the metatranscriptomic doublestranded DNA libraries with the 2019-nCoVirus DNA/
RNA Capture Panel (BOKE, Beijing, China). Negative controls prepared from nuclease-free water and total RNA isolated from human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were included.
The manufacturers instructions were slightly modified to
accommodate the MGISEQ-2000 platform, i.e., blocker oligos and PCR primer oligos were replaced by MGIEasy exon
capture assistive kit (MGI, Shenzhen, China). DNB-based libraries were constructed and sequenced on the MGISEQ2000 platform with paired-end 100 nt strategy using the
same protocol described above, generating 37 Gb sequencing data for each sample on average.
Metatranscriptomic library preparation and sequencing
Amplicon-based enrichment and sequencing
Host DNA was removed from RNA samples using
DNase I, and the concentration of RNA samples was
measured by Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). DNA-depleted and
purified RNA was used to construct the double-stranded
(ds) circular DNA library with MGIEasy RNA Library
preparation reagent set (MGI, Shenzhen, China), as
follows: (1) RNA was fragmented by incubating with
fragmentation buffer at 87 C for 6 min; (2) ds cDNA
was synthesized using random hexamers with fragmented RNA; (3) ds cDNA was subjected to end repair,
Total RNA was reverse transcribed to synthesize the
first-strand cDNA with random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA). Sequencing was attempted on all samples regardless of Ct value including negative controls prepared
from nuclease-free water and NA12878 human gDNA.
A two-step SARS-CoV-2 genome amplification was performed with an equimolar mixture of primers using
ATOPlex SARS-CoV-2 Full Length Genome Panel following the manufactures protocol (MGI, Shenzhen,
China), generating 137 ~ 400 bp amplicons or 299 ~

Twenty microliters of first-strand cDNA was mixed with
the components of the first PCR reaction following the
manufacturers instructions. Two nanograms of human
gDNA was added to each PCR reaction of the cultured
isolate. A set of controls was adopted to help quantifying
viral load and identify potential contamination. During
library construction for amplicon sequencing, each sample was mixed with a fixed copy number of lambda genomic DNA (external control), and the external control
and the SARS-CoV-2 genomes were amplified at the
same time. The PCR was performed as follows: 5 min at
37 C; 10 min at 95 C; 15 cycles of 10 s at 95 C, 1 min at
64 C, 1 min at 60 C, to 10 s at 72 C; and 2 min at 72 C.
The products were purified with MGI EasyDNA Clean
beads (MGI, BGI-Shenzhen, China) at a 5:4 ratio and
cleaned with 80% concentration ethanol according to
the manufacturers instructions. The 2nd PCR was performed under the same regimen as the 1st PCR except
for 25 cycles, and the bead-purified products from the
first PCR reaction were unique dual indexed. After the
2nd PCR, products were purified following the same
procedures as the 1st PCR and quantified using the
Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay on Qubit 3.0 (Life
Technologies). PCR products of samples yielding sufficient material (> 5 ng/l) were pooled at equimolar to a
total DNA amount of 300 ng before converting to
single-stranded circular DNA. DNB-based libraries were
generated from 20 l of single-stranded circular DNA
pools and sequenced on the MGISEQ-2000 platform
with single-end 400 nt strategy, generating 1.8 Gb
sequencing data for each sample on average.
Identification of Coronaviridae-like reads in massively
parallel sequencing data
For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing
data, total reads were first processed using Kraken
v0.10.5 [20] (default parameters) with a self-built database of Coronaviridae genomes (including SARS, MERS,
and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences downloaded from
GISAID, NCBI, and CNGB) to identify Coronaviridaelike reads in a loose manner. fastp v0.19.5 [21] (parameters: -q 20 -u 20 -n 1 -l 50) and SOAPnuke v1.5.6 [22]
were used to remove low-quality reads, duplications, and
adaptor contaminations. Low-complexity reads were
then removed using PRINSEQ v0.20.4 [23] (parameters:
-lc_method dust -lc_threshold 7). Samples that exhibited
higher coverage and at least 10-fold higher average
sequencing depth than negative controls were accepted
for downstream analyses of inter- and intra-individual
For amplicon sequencing data, SE400 reads were first
processed with fastp v0.19.5 [21] (parameters: -q 20 -u
20 -n 1 -l 50) to remove low-quality reads and adaptor
sequences. Primer sequences and the 21 nt upstream
and downstream of primers within the reads were then
trimmed with BAMClipper v1.1.1 [24] (parameters: -n 4
-u 21 -d 21). Reads with low-quality bases, adaptors,
primers, and adjacent sequences completely removed as
described above were considered as clean reads for
downstream analyses. The viral load of SARS-CoV-2
was quantified based on the data from both external
control and the target virus. We define a C = target viral
load/(target viral load + external control load), and a C >
0.1% of negative groups (prepared from human nucleic
only when the C value of the sample is an order of magnitude higher than that of negative groups, for instance,
if C < 0.01% for all negative controls and C > 0.1% for an
experimental group.
Genome assembly of SARS-CoV-2
For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing,
the Coronaviridae-like reads of samples with < 100
average sequencing depth were directly de novo assembled with SPAdes (v3.14.0, [25]) using the default
settings. The Coronaviridae-like reads of samples with >
100 average sequencing depth across SARS-CoV-2 genome were subsampled to achieve 100 sequencing depth
before being assembled.
For amplicon sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 consensus
sequences were generated using Pilon v1.23 [26] (parameters: --changes vcf --changes --vcf --mindepth 1 --fix
all, amb). Nucleotide positions with sequencing depth <
100 or < 5-fold higher than that of negative controls
were masked as ambiguous base N.
Visualization of coverage depth across the viral genomes
The Coronaviridae-like reads from metatranscriptomic
and hybrid capture sequencing data were aligned against
the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GISAID accession:
EPI_ISL_402119) [27] with BWA aln (v0.7.16) [28]. Duplications were identified by Picard Markduplicates
default settings. For each sample, we calculated the
depth of coverage at each nucleotide position of the
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome with SAMtools (v1.9)
[29] and scaled the values to the mean depth. For each
nucleotide position, we calculated the median depth and
20th and 80th percentiles across all samples. Coverage
depth across the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was
plotted within a 200-nt sliding window using the ggplot2
[30] package in R (v3.6.1) [31].
Xiao et al. Genome Medicine
Amplicon sequencing data was processed as described
above, except that duplications were not removed. A
heatmap was generated to visualize the viral genome
coverage for all samples sequenced by the amplicon
method with the pheatmap v1.0.12 [32] package in R
(v3.6.1) [31]. The depth at each nucleotide position was
binarized and was shown in blue if depth of coverage
was 100 and above.
Relationship between viral load and minimum
sequencing output across methods
SARS-CoV-2 reads of metatranscriptomic and hybrid
capture sequencing data were identified by aligning the
Coronaviridae-like reads against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_402119) [27]
with BWA in a strict manner of coverage  95% and
identity  90%. For comparisons of the coverage depth
of the viral genome across samples and methods, we
normalized the viral reads to total sequencing reads with
SARS-CoV-2 reads per million (SARS-CoV-2-RPM).
SARS-CoV-2-RPM for amplicon sequencing data was
calculated by the same pipeline applied for metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing data.
To estimate the minimum data required for genome
assembly and genome variation analysis, we applied
gradient-based sampling to the SARS-CoV-2 genome
alignments (referred to BAM files) to each dataset using
SAMtools (v1.9) [29]. The effective genome coverage
was set as 95% for all three MPS methods. Considering
the distinct technologies used in different methods, we
set method-dependent thresholds of effective depth as
follows: (1)  10 for metatranscriptomic sequencing, (2)
 20 for hybrid capture sequencing, and (3)  100 for
amplicon sequencing. We next calculated the coverage
and depth within each subsampled BAM file per sample
to determine the minimal BAM file that could meet the
above thresholds of both coverage and sequencing
depth. The method-dependent minimum sequencing
output of each sample was estimated accordingly. We
assessed the correlations between the SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per milliliter in diluted samples of cultured
isolates and the minimum sequencing output for amplicon- and capture-based methods using Pearsons correlation coefficient (R) with the function scatter from the R
package (v3.6.1) ggpubr (v0.2.5) [33].
Analysis of inter- and intra-individual variants
For metatranscriptomic and hybrid capture sequencing
data, variant calling was performed based on the BAM
processed as described above, except that duplications
were not removed. Variants were first called with
freebayes (v1.3.1) [34] (parameters: -p 1 -q 20 -m 60
--min-coverage 10 -V), and the low-confidence variants
were removed with snippy-vcf_filter (v3.2) [35] (parameters: --minqual 100 --mincov 10 --minfrac 0.8). The
remaining variants in VCF files generated by freebayes
were annotated in SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and
com/alimanfoo/pysamstats) (parameters: -type variation_
strand --min-baseq 20 -D 1000000) was used to count
the number of matches, mismatches, deletions, and insertions at each base to determine the allele frequencies.
Variant calls with allele frequencies  80% were identified as SNVs.
Nucleotide positions with  100 sequencing depth
from amplicon sequencing,  10 from metatranscriptomic sequencing, and  20 from capture sequencing
were kept for iSNV calling. The candidate iSNVs were
further filtered as follows: (1) frequency filtering, only
minor alleles (frequency  5% and < 50%) and major alleles (frequency  50% and  95%) were remained; (2)
depth filtering, iSNVs with fewer than five forward or reverse reads were removed; and (3) strand bias filtering
(not applicable to single-end reads of amplicon sequencing), iSNVs were removed if there were more than a
10-fold strand bias or a 5-fold difference between the
strand bias of the variant call and that of the reference
Taxonomy of clinical samples by unbiased
metatranscriptomic sequencing
For metatranscriptomic sequencing of clinical samples,
raw sequencing data of a single sequence lane (approximately 6075 Gb per sample) was used to simultaneously assess the RNA expression patterns of human,
bacteria, and viruses in clinical samples from COVID-19
patients. We first used the software fastp (v0.19.5) [21]
to filter low-quality reads and remove adapter with parameters: -5 -3 -q 20 -c -l 30. After QC, we mapped
high-quality reads to hg19 and removed human ribosomal RNA (rRNA) reads by using SOAP2 v2.21 [37] (parameters: -m 0 -x 1000 -s 28 -l 32 -v 5 -r 1), and the
remaining RNA reads were then aligned to hg19 by
HISAT2 [38] with default settings to identify non-rRNA
human transcripts as previously described. Next, we applied Kraken 2 [39] (version 2.0.8-beta, parameters:
--threads 24 --confidence 0) to assign microbial taxonomic ranks to non-human RNA reads against the large
reference database MiniKraken2 (April 2019, 8 GB) built
from the Refseq bacteria, archaea, and viral libraries and
the h38 human genome. Bracken [40] (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with Kraken) was further applied
to estimate microbial relative abundances based on taxonomic ranks of reads assigned by Kraken2.

Design of the comparative study
We sampled eight specimens from COVID-19 patients
in February 2020, including throat swab, nasal swab, anal
swab, and sputum specimens, and the corresponding
cycle threshold (Ct) value of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR
boost the coverage and depth of the viral genome by
ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing with an
average sequencing output of 1,607,264,105 paired-end
complete viral genome assemblies for each specimen,
the sequencing depth varied across specimens. Only
0.0020.003% of the total reads were assigned to the
SARS-CoV-2 in three samples (GZMU0014, GZM
U0030, and GZMU0031) with Ct between 29 and 32,
resulting in inferior sequencing depth (less than 100)
culture might improve the situation, but this requires
high-standard laboratory settings and expertise apart
from being time-consuming. Also, unexpected mutations
that are not concordant with original clinical samples
may be introduced during the culturing process.
To enrich adequate viral content for whole-genome
sequencing in a convenient manner, we pursued two
other methods: multiplex PCR amplification (amplicon)
and hybrid capture (capture) (Fig. 1). We designed a systematic study to comprehensively validate the uniformity, sensitivity, and inter-individual (variant) and intraindividual (iSNV) accuracy of multiple approaches by
performed qRT-PCR of 10-fold serial dilutions (D1D7)
of the cultured isolate, and the Ct was 17.3, 20.8, and
24.5 for 28.7, 31.8, 35, and 39.9, respectively, indicating
the undiluted RNA (D0) of the cultured isolate contained ~ 1E+08 genome copies per milliliter. For amplicon sequencing, we utilized two kits comprising two sets
of primers generating PCR products of 300400 bp and
100200 bp, respectively. The ~ 400 bp amplicon-based
sequencing was implemented in all samples and
analyzed throughout the study, while the ~ 200 bp
amplicon-based sequencing was only applied in the cultured isolate for coverage analysis.
Comparison of uniformity and sensitivity
Theoretically, amplicon sequencing should be the most
sensitive and economical method among the three and
are highly related. Although, there are still potential pitfalls, for instance, the 40-cycle PCR in our workflow
might augment trace amounts of SARS-CoV-2 crosscontamination. To ensure the confidence of the datasets,
we included serial dilutions of the cultured isolate and
negative controls prepared from nuclease-free water and
human nucleic acids since the 1st PCR. All samples in ~
400 bp amplicon-based sequencing exhibited > 99.5%
coverage of 1 depth across the SARS-CoV-2 genome
except for 1E+01 (95.23%), GZMU0031 (73.65%), HNA
(6.17%), and water (60.24%) and > 97.00% coverage of
100 depth across the SARS-CoV-2 genome except for
GZMU0030 (94.15%), GZMU0042 (88.17%), GZMU0014
(71.66%), D7 (39.49%), GZMU0031 (0.00%), HNA
(0.00%), and water (0.00%), suggesting the primers were
well designed and the positive datasets were reliable
(Fig. 3a). We also set stringent and method-specific criteria to filter low-confidence sequencing reads and samples based on a set of controls (see the Methods
section). Another pitfall is that amplification across the
genome can hardly be unbiased, causing difficulties in
complete genome assembly. Indeed, amplicon sequencing exhibited a lower level of uniformity compared with
metatranscriptomic sequencing, in terms of coverage
across the viral genomes from the cultural isolate and
the clinical samples tested in our study (Fig. 3b, d; Additional file 2 Fig. S1). To our surprise, however, capture

lower SARS-CoV-2-RPM than the other two methods
among clinical samples tested with a wide range of Ct
values (Fig. 3e). The productivity was similar between
the other two methods when the input RNA of the cultured isolate contained 1E+05 genome copies per milliliter and above (Fig. 3e). However, amplicon sequencing
produced 10- to 100-fold more SARS-CoV-2 reads than
capture sequencing when the input RNA concentration
of the cultured isolate was 1E+04 genome copies per
milliliter and lower, suggesting amplicon-based enrichment was more efficient than capture for more challenging samples (conc.  1E+04 genome copies per
milliliter, or Ct  28.7) (Fig. 3e). Meta sequencingas expectedproduced dramatically lower SARS-CoV-2-RPM

than the other two methods among clinical samples
tested with a wide range of Ct values, whereas amplicon
and capture were generally comparable to each other
(Fig. 3f). Considering the costs for sequencing, storage,
and analysis increase substantially with larger datasets,
we tried to estimate how much sequencing data must be
produced for each approach in order to achieve 10
depth across 95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and the
practical, cost-effective guidance for future sequencing,
we also assessed the minimum sequencing output required to pass the stringent filters ( 95% coverage and
method-specific depth, see the Methods section) in
our pipelines corresponding to different viral loads. We
estimated that for high-confidence downstream analyses,
amplicon sequencing requires at least 2757 to 186 megabases (Mb) for samples containing 1E+02 to 1E+06 copies of SARS-CoV-2 genome per milliliter, while capture
frequencies detected in capture sequencing datasets were
generally approximate to meta sequencing, while most
allele frequencies in amplicon sequencing datasets deviated with those in meta sequencing (Fig. 4c). A similar
pattern was shown for clinical samples, indicating that
amplicon sequencing was unreliable of quantifying
minor allele frequencies (Fig. 4d). Plotting allele frequencies against SARS-CoV-2 concentrations supported the
above finding and further revealed that amplicon
sequencing was unreliable of allele frequencies at all
concentrations while capture sequencing was reliable at
> 1E+03 genome copies per milliliter (Additional file 2
Fig. S3). Referring to the iSNV identified in clinical samples by meta sequencing, we then calculated the false
positive rate (FPR) of minor alleles called by amplicon
and capture methods. The FPR of minor alleles identified in amplicon sequencing was 0.74%, while that in
capture sequencing was 0.02%. Together, these results
suggest amplicon sequencing was not as accurate as capture sequencing in identifying minor alleles.
Investigation of inter- and intra-individual variations
Microbiome in clinical samples
To determine the accuracy of different approaches in
discovering inter-individual genetic diversity, we tested
each method in calling the single nucleotide variations
(SNVs) and verified some of the SNVs with Sanger sequencing (Additional file 2 Fig. S2). Two to five SNVs
were identified within each clinical sample, and in all the
seven samples, SNVs identified by the three methods
were concordant except that capture missed one SNV at
position 16535 in GZMU0014 (Fig. 4a). We then investigated the allele frequencies of these sites across methods
and found that alleles identified by capture sequencing
displayed lower frequencies than the other two methods,
especially for GZMU0014, GZMU0030, and GZMU0042
where the viral load was lower (Ct  29), which explained
why capture sequencing neglected an SNV in our pipeline when the cutoff of SNV calling was set as 80% allele
frequency (Fig. 4b). These data indicate that amplicon
sequencing is more accurate than capture sequencing in
identifying SNVs, especially for challenging samples.
To further determine the accuracy of different approaches in identifying SARS-CoV-2 iSNVs, we examined minor allele frequencies in serial dilutions of the
cultured SARS-CoV-2 isolate and clinical samples. For
serial dilutions of the cultured isolate, the minor allele
In addition to target viral genome, metatranscriptomic
sequencing has also allowed us to investigate RNA expression patterns of the overall microbiome and host
distinguishing co-infections, and dissecting virus-host interactions. To explore the microbiota, we performed further metatranscriptomic analysis of the clinical samples.
We were able to identify host nucleic acids in all of the
samples, and over 95% of total reads were from the host
in sputum, nasal, and throat samples (Additional file 2
Fig. S4a). Virus contributed to less than 5% of reads in
anal swab and throat swab while more than 50% of reads
in nasal swab (Additional file 2 Fig. S4b). These results
suggest nasal swab could be the most ideal sample type
for viral detection among the four sample types, which
agrees with recent clinical evidence [45]. Previous studies have compared different sample types of other coronaviruses
nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat and nose swabs appear to be the most useful clinical specimens in the first
5 days of illness caused by SARS-CoV infection [46] and
nasal swabs are the candidate sample of choice for detecting MERS-CoV using qRT-PCR technology in apparently healthy camels [47].

Guidance for virus sequencing
Taken together, each sequencing scheme elaborated here
a reasonable, cost-effective strategy for sequencing and
analyzing SARS-CoV-2 under different situations: (1) if
one wants to study other genetic materials than the
target viruses, or the viruses become highly diversified

RNA sample is high (e.g., conc.  1E+05 viral genome
copies per milliliter, or Ct  24.5), meta sequencing can
be prioritized; (2) if one focuses on intra-individual variations for more challenging samples (e.g., conc. < 1E+05
and > 1E+03 viral genome copies per milliliter, or Ct >
24.5 and < 31.8), capture sequencing seems to be a justified choice; and (3) if identifying SNVs is the main
purpose, the most convenient, economical strategy
would be amplicon sequencing that can support analyses
of samples containing lower than 1E+05 viral genome
copies per milliliter, or Ct > 24.5.
Sequencing low-titer viruses directly from clinical samples is challenging, especially for coronaviruses that are
the largest among RNA viruses (~ 3-fold larger compared with ZIKV). Isolating viruses and enriching them
in cell culture require high-standard laboratory settings
and expertise apart from being time-consuming. The enrichment methods presented here have several advantagesto different degreesover the other existing
protocols [48, 49]. Firstly, the multiplex PCR protocol
for ZIKV sequencing [48] and the Artic Network protocol for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing [49] require library
preparation after PCR. Our amplicon method is more
convenient since the barcoding and adaptor ligation
steps are integrated into the PCR process; in other
words, the PCR products are the library. Secondly, we
adopt a set of controls to help us quantify viral load and
identify potential contamination. During library construction for amplicon sequencing, each sample was
mixed with standard lambda genomic DNA (external
control), and the external control and the SARS-CoV-2
genomes are amplified at the same time. After sequencing, the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is quantified based
on the data from both external control and the target
virus. We define a C = target viral load/(target viral
load + external control load), and a C > 0.1% of negative
groups (prepared from human nucleic acids and
value of the sample is an order of magnitude higher than
that of negative groups, for instance, if C < 0.01% for all
negative controls and C > 0.1% for an experimental
group. Finally, our work is the first that focuses around
the use of BGI and MGI materials and platforms while
previous protocols were mainly designed for Illumina or
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT).
Compared with direct metatranscriptomic sequencing,
hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing methods are
more sensitive but less accurate and neither of the two
can be used to sequence highly diverse or recombinant
viruses because the primers and probes are specific to
known viral genomes. Although amplicon sequencing
compromises its accuracy, it becomes the most convenient and economical method of all. Either or a combination of the approaches described here can be chosen to
cope with various needs of researchers, e.g., metatranscriptomic sequencing data with insufficient coverage
and depth can be pooled with hybrid capture data to
generate high-quality assemblies [44]. From the perspective of virologists who conduct genomic studies of
SARS-CoV-2, one dilemma is that there is hardly any
standard of which sequencing method should be chosen
for different samples or research purposes. Clinical specimens are precious, and it is unlikely to test each method
on them. Of course, time and cost are also important
factors that are needed to be considered. Therefore, in
this work, we systematically examined the advantages
and disadvantages of each method using different samples and proposed a guidance for rationally choosing the
Moreover, we estimated the minimum sequencing output required for different samples using each method.
This is another frequently encountered question, because larger output requires higher sequencing expenses,
larger storage space, and more computing resources.
The most cost-effective way is to generate the minimum
amount of data needed for downstream analyses. Our
work provides practical help for researchers to estimate
how much data is necessary, although it varies with experimental procedures (e.g., total RNA extraction, rRNA
depletion) and sample types (e.g., nasal swab typically requires less data than other sample types), and thus
should be determined case by case.
Some advantages and disadvantages described above
might be specific to the experimental workflows and bioinformatic pipelines presented in the current work, for
instance, (1) the uniformity of amplicon sequencing can
be improved by reducing the amount of cycles in the 1st
PCR to 13 while increasing that in the 2nd PCR to 17 or
increasing the molar ratios of primers targeting the region with low coverage, e.g., genomic position 16965
17246; (2) the amplicon sequencing is particularly convenient compared with previous counterparts since the
standard fragmentation and library construction steps
are omitted here by integrating adaptor and barcode
ligation in the 2nd PCR and sequencing the amplicons
using single-end 400 nt reads; (3) using less than 506
pieces of 120 ssDNA probes in hybrid capture may
attenuate the sequencing coverage while decrease the
uniformity; (4) metatranscriptomic sequencing was conducted with an ultra-high-throughput sequencing platform so that the successful rate was substantially higher
than usual; and (5) the minimal amount of data necessary for analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 genome from clinical
samples across methods can be deviated from that predicted by data from the cultured isolate, and this was

possibly due to the fact that nucleic acid background
from the host and other microbes varies (Additional file 2
consider the time spent in sequencing since the workflows can be easily adapted to various platforms including Illumina and ONT, besides DNBSEQ of MGI.
All three methods can effectively obtain SARS-CoV-2
genome information from clinical samples and can be
used to study genome variations of the virus. However,
the sensitivity, accuracy, and cost of the three methods
vary greatly, and thus, each method must be rationally
chosen to cope with different research purposes and
different clinical samples. This work offers practical
guidance for genome sequencing and analyses of SARSCoV-2 and other emerging viruses.
