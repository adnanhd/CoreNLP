A successful global healthcare response relies on versatile vaccines and production of broadly
virus-neutralizing antibodies by the immune system to protect us from emerging infectious
diseases. The present 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
pandemic highlights the urgent need for development of anti-viral biodefense. Due to the genetic
and proteomic diversities of viral pathogens, establishing versatile anti-viral vaccines or
therapeutic agents is highly challenging. Carbohydrate antigens represent an important class of
immunological targets for vaccine development and immunotherapy against microbial infections.

As the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic rages, it is clear that an efficacious global
healthcare response must include multipurpose vaccines that stimulate production of broadly
virus-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against emerging viral pathogens. Due to the genomic
and proteomic diversities of viral pathogens, establishing such countermeasures against viral
infections is difficult. The recent outbreaks of diseases caused by coronaviruses (CoVs),
including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1, 2], the Middle
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3, 4], and the 2019-nCoV in the
present outbreak [59], pose new challenges to global efforts to combat infectious diseases.
Protein targets
The 2019-nCoV has been phylogenetically mapped to the same Betacoronavirus clade as
SARS-CoV [10, 11] and, accordingly, classified as SARS-CoV-2 [12]. However, the two
viruses differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. As compared to the consensus
sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-like viruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains 380 amino acid

substitutions in total and 27 substitutions in the spike glycoprotein (S) critical for viral entry
and antibody-mediated virus-neutralization [10, 11]. Although the overall structure of
SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of SARS-CoV, and shares the same functional host cell
receptorangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in
the SARS-CoV-2-S differs significantly from that of SARS-CoV-S, most notably in five of
the six amino acid residues critical for binding to ACE2 [9]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
specific for the RBD of SARS-CoV-S have no cross-reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2-S RBD
[13]. Characteristic structural elements in SARS-CoV-2-S include a furin cleavage site at the
boundary between the S1/S2 subunits and three adjacent potential O-glycosylation sites not
previously seen in lineage-B betacoronaviruses. Nevertheless, murine polyclonal anti-sera to
SARS-CoV-S potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S-mediated entry into target cells [14],
indicating the presence of shared antigenic structuresperhaps in the more conserved S2
region of the two CoVs. Much remains to be learned about the antigenic characteristics of
the new CoV as compared to SARS-CoV and other human CoVs [15, 16].
Immunogenic carbohydrate moieties
Carbohydrates represent an important class of microbial antigens. These molecules are
structurally diverse and prominently displayed on the surfaces of virtually every microbial
pathogen [17, 18]. In 1917, Dochez and Avery [19] found that when Pneumococci were
grown in fluid media, there was a substance in the culture fluid that precipitated specifically
with antisera to the same Pneumococcus. Heidelberger and Avery [20] showed the substance
recognized by the antibodies was a carbohydrate molecule and not a protein, as previously
thought. It was later shown that almost every microorganism expresses such sugar signatures
recognized by the host immune systems and that they are effective in stimulating specific
antibody responses [17, 18]. Such immunogenic carbohydrate moieties often serve as key
targets for development of vaccines against infectious diseases [2125]. A large panel of
pathogen-specific carbohydrate moieties has been identified; some have been successfully
explored for use in vaccines or targeted immunotherapy against microbial infections [21
eradicated childhood meningitis and systemic lethal bacterial infection caused by
Haemophilus influenzae B [23, 24, 2628]
Like bacterial pathogens, viruses also decorate their outer surfaces with carbohydrate
moieties. Unlike bacteria, which have evolved their own machineries for glycosylation and
often produce unique sugar chain signatures, viruses depend on host cells for glycosylation
and generally decorate their virions with the self-glycans of corresponding hosts. This
sugar shield is thought to be one of the strategies viruses evolved to escape host immune
rejection. For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [29], Lassa virus [30],
hepatitis C virus [31], and EpsteinBarr virus [32] exhibit extensive N-linked glycans
covering the exposed protein surfaces, including critical virus-neutralizing protein epitopes.
Similarly, CoV S glycans mask the protein surface and consequently limit antibody access to
protein-neutralizing epitopes [33].
Viral glycan shields as vaccine targets
New ideas and innovative strategies are urgently needed to establish multipurpose vaccines
against the emergence or re-emergence of unexpected viral pathogens. Recently,
carbohydrate researchers undertook an investigation to explore whether viruses of distinct
phylogenetic origins, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), HIV-1, and SARS-CoV,
neutralization [34]. The assumption was that viruses depend on host glycosylation
machinery for glycan synthesis and thereby may express the conserved viral carbohydrates.
These studies led to the recognition of several glyco-antigens co-expressed by these viruses,
including not only the known oligomannosyl antigens but also the previously less studied
of N-glycan cryptic autoantigens with unique immunological properties. They are generally
present intracellularly as glycosylation intermediates, but become overexpressed and/or
surface-exposed by some viral pathogens [3537] as well as tumor cells [3840]. Thus,
induction of immune responses to these targets is unlikely to be harmful to normal cells.
Instead, antibodies or lectins targeting these cryptic intracellular antigens are likely essential
for the clearance of autoantigens released from the aged or apoptotic cells in vivo [41, 42].
Interestingly, a broadly virus-neutralizing agent, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA),
recognizes specific targets in the panel and effectively neutralizes many viruses [34, 4346],
including SARS-CoV [34, 43].
A common feature of CoVs is that their S glycoproteins are densely decorated by N-linked
glycans protruding from the surfaces of the virions [33, 4749]. The SARS-CoV-2-S
comprises 22 N-linked glycosylation sites, and 16 of them were resolved in the cryo-electron
microscopy (cryoEM) map as glycosylated. By comparison, SARS-CoV-S possesses 23 Nlinked glycosylation sites with at least 19 of them confirmed to be glycosylated [47]. Twenty
out of 22 SARS-CoV-2-S N-linked glycosylation sites are conserved in SARS-CoV-S.
Specifically, 9 out of 13 sites in the S1 subunit and all 9 sites in the S2 subunit are conserved
among SARS-CoV-2-S and SARS-CoV-S. CoVs may overexpress the high-mannose type
since CoV virions are likely matured in and directly bud from the endoplasmic reticulum
Golgi intermediate compartment without further editing by the Golgi-residential glycoenzymes [33, 50]. Thus, it is important to determine whether or not SARS-CoV-2 and other
CoVs also express these GNA-positive glyco-determinants and other glycan-based virusneutralizing epitopes.
Challenges and opportunities in CoV vaccine development
The current COVID-19 pandemic has ignited global efforts toward development of an
effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine [5153]. One of the key targeted immunogens is SARSCoV-2-S glycoprotein since it is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via
conformational changes, internalization of the virus, and host tissue tropism [54]. A novel
Inc., Cambridge, MA), was designed to express a full-length, prefusion stabilized SARSCoV-2-S protein. Since the human cells of each vaccinated person express the protein in
vivo, the immunogen produced by mRNA-1273 can be viewed as a form of natural
glycoconjugate with the sugar moieties displayed by the precisely translated S-protein
carrier. This type of vaccine may induce T-dependent antibody responses to the glycoldeterminants. Ideally, this RNA-based vaccine may trigger both anti-protein and anti-glycan
antibody responses in vivo to enhance anti-SAR-SCoV-2 immunity. Similarly, other vaccine
produce S glycoprotein may also express carbohydrate epitopes. Thus, analyzing the vaccine
responses may provide very useful data to evaluate potential immunogenicity of vaccine
components, including proteins and carbohydrates.
Carbohydrate microarrays have proven to be a powerful means for exploring the
immunogenic sugar moieties recognized by host immune systems to mount antibody
responses [22, 35, 5558]. Unlike a conventional S glycoprotein immunoassay that detects
the sum of anti-protein and anti-glycan antibodies, carbohydrate microarrays can be
designed to present either pure carbohydrate moieties [22, 59] or glycoconjugates [46, 60]
lacking S protein components and, thereby, can be used to decipher anti-glycan and antiprotein antibodies for a given immunogen or pathogen. Characterizing a SARS-CoV-2
vaccine response or COVID-19 patients serological response using carbohydrate
microarrays is, therefore, a practical approach to verify whether SARS-CoV-2 is also
decorated with glyco-determinants that are promising immunological targets.
Due to variation in glycosylation patterns among different cell types, CoV virions produced
by different cells may also carry unique glycan signatures. For example, bat cells carry many
non-human glycans, such as non-human sialic acids [61], the Galili alpha-Gal epitopes [62],
and, perhaps, bisecting GlcNAc moieties [63]. Whether the bat cell-produced CoVs express
these highly immunogenic sugar moieties and if human infection caused by the first wave of
bat-CoVs triggered hyperimmune responses to these non-human glycans and contributed to
severity of the diseases remains to be seen. Characterizing cohorts of COVID-19 patients
from different epicentersespecially a comparative serological study of the early onset
sample sets and the later human-human transmitted sample sets using carbohydrate
microarrays and other glycan-specific immunoassaysmay uncover important glycoimmunological information to guide development of glyco-conjugate vaccines and
therapeutic antibodies to target the sugar shield of SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps other
unexpected CoVs with human outbreak potential. The glyco-conjugate vaccines without any
CoV protein component may have the unique advantage of avoiding undesired vaccine
responses to the S-protein epitopes that were non-neutralizing but elicited the antibodydependent enhancement of infectivity and severe Th2-type lung immunopathy observed
during SARS-CoV vaccine development [53, 6469].

Asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) and agalacto-OR (AGOR) were chemically prepared to expose
cryptic glyco-epitopes, tri-antennary or multi-valent type II (Tri/m-II) and Tri/m-GlcNAc

illustrated, these glyco-epitopes are recognized by specific virus-neutralizing agents: a)
mannosyl-epitopes recognized by 2G12 or GNA; b) Tri/m-Gn epitopes stained by GNA or
wheat germ agglutinin (WGA); and c) Tri/m-II epitopes that are highly reactive with PHA-L
