The  results  of this survey indicate that mental health symptoms
may have been common during the COVID‐19 outbreak among the  gen‐
eral  population in China, especially among infected individuals,
people with suspected infection, and people who might  have  con‐
tact  with patients with COVID‐19. Some measures, such as quaran‐
tine and delays in returning to work, were also  associated  with
mental  health  among the public. These findings identify popula‐
tions at risk for mental health problems during the COVID‐19 pan‐
demic  and  may  help  in implementing mental health intervention
policies in other countries and regions.  In December  2019,  the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) outbreak occurred and aroused
global attention.1 It has infected more than 6.1  million  people
and  caused 376 000 deaths worldwide across 216 countries, areas,
or territories according to June 3, 2020,  data  from  the  World
Health  Organization.2 In contrast to previous epidemics and pan‐
demics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East
respiratory  syndrome,  COVID‐19  is  more contagious and spreads
faster.3 The World Health Organization officially announced  that
COVID‐19 was a pandemic and called on the whole world to work to‐
gether to confront this infection.4 Compulsory measures, such  as
implemented  in China and other countries to impede further esca‐
lation of the pandemic.5‐8  Facing  this  large‐scale  infectious
public health event and these enormous disruptions to daily life,
people are under unprecedented pressure and are experiencing  se‐
vere  psychological  distress.9  Few  studies  have  investigated
COVID‐19related mental health symptoms in the general population.
One  pilot  study10 in China reported that nearly one‐half of the
respondents considered the mental health impact  of  COVID‐19  as
moderate  or severe, and one‐third exhibited anxiety symptoms. To
set priorities for public health policies and implement effective
health  care interventions, the prevalence of mental health symp‐
toms and  factors  that  are  associated  with  them  during  the
COVID‐19  outbreak  need to be determined urgently. Thus, we con‐
ducted a large‐sample, anxiety, insomnia, and  acute  stress  and
potential risk factors in the general population in China.  Study

al Population During the COVID‐19 Outbreak in China in China. The
survey link was posted on the website. We used a convenience sam‐
pling  method.  The  registered  members  clicked the link on the
platform and responded to the survey voluntarily until the conve‐
nience  sample  covered  all  34 province‐level regions in China.
This was an anonymous survey, and confidentiality of data was en‐
sured.  Study Population The respondents were all registered mem‐
bers of Joybuy. A total of 71 227 individuals clicked on the sur‐
vey link, and 57 006 individuals commenced the survey, among whom
74 individuals refused to provide informed  consent  and  56  932
participants  provided  informed  consent and submitted the ques‐
tionnaires. One hundred fifty‐six  questionnaires  that  did  not
provide  valid  age  information were excluded from the analysis.
Ninety‐seven respondents who were younger than 18 years were also
present conditions.  Measurements and Covariates The survey last‐
ed approximately 15 minutes and had 4 parts. The first part gath‐
ered  demographic information of the participants, including gen‐
der, age, living area (urban vs rural), level of education, mari‐
tal  status, monthly family income, geographic region, history of
chronic diseases, history of psychiatric disorders, family histo‐
ry  of  psychiatric  disorders,  and  occupation. The second part
asked epidemic‐related questions. The third part evaluated isola‐
tion  conditions  and  social attitudes toward The fourth part of
the questionnaire consisted of 4 standardized  scales,  including
the Chinese versions of Patient Health Questionnaire9,11 General‐
ized Anxiety Disorder7,12 Insomnia Severity  Index,13  and  Acute
Stress  Disorder  Scale,14 which measured symptoms of depression,
anxiety, insomnia, and  acute  stress,  respectively.  The  total
scores  of  these  scales  were  interpreted  as follows: Patient
Health  Questionnaire9,  normal  (0‐4),  mild   (5‐9),   moderate
(10‐14),  and severe (15‐27) depression; Generalized Anxiety Dis‐
order7, normal (0‐4), mild (5‐9), moderate  (10‐14),  and  severe
(15‐21)  anxiety;  Insomnia  Severity  Index,  normal (0‐7), sub‐
threshold (8‐14), moderate (15‐21), and severe (22‐28)  insomnia;
and  Acute Stress Disorder Scale, acute stress symptoms (a disso‐
ciative cluster score 9 and  cumulative  re‐experiencing,  avoid‐
ance,  and arousal cluster scores 28). In the present study, cut‐
off scores of 5 for the Patient Health Questionnaire9, 5 for  the
Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder7  scale,  and  8  for the Insomnia
Severity Index were adopted to  detect  symptoms  of  depression,
anxiety, and insomnia.  In this study, frontline workers are con‐
sidered to be individuals who directly participated in  the  con‐
trol  of  COVID‐19,  covering  a  wide  range of occupations (eg,
medicine, research, public health, media, security work,  police,
community  work,  emergency  material delivery services, charity,
construction,  management,  and   psychological   interventions).
Frontline  workers  were presumed to have direct contact with pa‐
tients with COVID‐19. They were also presumed to possess personal
protective equipment when they were in contact with patients with
COVID‐19. People with occupational exposure risks are individuals
who  did not necessarily participate in COVID‐19 control but were
required to contact people at work and  could  subjectively  con‐
ceive  of  threats of being infected, including sanitary workers,
taxi drivers, and supermarket workers, among  others.  They  were
presumed  to  be  poorly  equipped with self‐protective measures.
Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to  present
demographic data. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxi‐
ety, insomnia, and acute stress was calculated using  the  afore‐
mentioned  cutoff scores and reported as the percentages of cases
in different populations. The 95% CIs were JAMA  Network  Open  |

During the COVID‐19 Outbreak in China produced by the exact bino‐
mial  methods.  2  tests  were  used to compare the prevalence of
mild‐tosevere mental health symptoms in different populations. To
explore  factors potentially associated with depression, anxiety,
insomnia, and acute stress, unadjusted  logistic  regression  and
multiple  logistic  regression  analyses were performed, and odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs are  presented.   Two‐sided  Wald  tests
were  conducted  to  determine  whether the ORs in the regression
models were statistically significant. All of the variables  that
were statistically significant in the unadjusted regression anal‐
ysis and those that might convey important information  were  en‐
tered  into the the Supplement. The level of significance was set
to P < .05. All of the statistical analyses were performed  using
SPSS  statistical  software  version 22 (IBM Corp). Data analysis
was performed from March to May 2020.   Demographic  Characteris‐
tics  Data  from a total of 56 679 eligible participants were in‐
cluded in the final analysis, for a participation rate  of  79.9%
(56 932 of 71 227 participants). The participants included in the
analysis represented all 34 province‐level regions in  China.  Of
the  total sample, 27 149 participants (47.9%) were male, and the
mean (SD) age was 35.97 (8.22) years; 39 468 participants (69.6%)
were  aged  18  to 39 years. Of (77.2%) were married. Most of the
participants (52 839 participants [93.2%]) lived in urban  areas,
and  2352  (4.1%) were from Hubei province (ie, the province most
severely affected by COVID‐19 in China). This survey included da‐
ta  from 100 individuals (0.2%) with confirmed or suspected cases
of COVID‐19, 219 (0.4%) people who were in close contact with pa‐
tients  with COVID‐19, and 9725 (17.2%) frontline workers. Of the
total number of respondents, 608 (1.1%) had  at  least  1  family
member  or  friend who was infected with COVID‐19, 17 587 (31.0%)
had at least 1 family member or friend who was a frontline  work‐
er, 16 454 (29.0%) had quarantine experience, 19 754 (34.9%) were
not yet back to work, and 2904 (5.1%) had  occupational  exposure
risks.  Additional  demographic and Prevalence of Symptoms of De‐
pression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and Acute Stress The  prevalence  of
symptoms  for the 4 mental health conditions among the total sam‐
ple was 27.9% (95% CI, 27.5%‐28.2%) for depression (15  802  par‐

during which rates of moderate‐to‐severe depression, moderate‐to‐
severe  anxiety,  and  insomnia in China were approximately 6.0%,
5.3%, and 15.0%, respectively.16‐19 The prevalence of psychiatric
morbidities during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic
in Singapore was reported to be 22.9%,20 and one‐third of  people
exhibited psychological distress during the equine influenza out‐
break in Australia.21 The prevalence was in accordance with  pre‐
vious  studies  of  such psychiatric problems during other disas‐
ters.22,23 These findings indicate that severe emotional distress
occurs  among  the general population during public health events
and underscore the importance of preventing and  treating  mental
health  problems during the COVID‐19 outbreak.  The present study
identified several population groups who were likely  to  develop
mental  health  symptoms.  Compared with uninfected people, those
with confirmed or suspected COVID‐19 were 2 to 3 times more like‐
ly  to  report mental health symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms
of the 4 mental health conditions was high  among  patients  with
COVID‐19  (depression,  75.0%;  anxiety,  71.0%; insomnia, 68.0%;
acute stress, 71.0%). This is partially consistent with  findings
among  patients  with  severe  acute  respiratory syndrome.24 The

COVID‐19 were susceptible to mental health disturbances. We found
that nearly 50% of family members or  friends  of  patients  with
COVID‐19  experienced mild‐tosevere mental health symptoms. Loved
ones experiencing negative outcomes  during  disasters  has  been
shown to be a strong catalyst of mental health disorders.26,27 In
addition, relatives of patients with COVID‐19 may worry about be‐
coming  infected  themselves,  may  be  quarantined, and may feel
stigmatized, all  of  which  may  exacerbate  psychological  dis‐
tress.28,29 The present study also found that people with occupa‐
tional exposure risks reported greater  symptoms  of  depression,
anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress. People who work in high‐risk
environments often  report  more  fatigue,  health  worries,  and
fear.30 COVID‐19 may be symptomless during the incubation period,
and its clinical manifestations can be easily confused with those
of  normal  influenza.31,32  Therefore, people may understandably
feel a threat of becoming infected by being  exposed  to  general
patients,  thereby affecting their psychological well‐being. How‐
ever, in the present study, frontline work was not  significantly
associated  with  depression  or anxiety. A previous study33 sug‐
gested that people at moderate infection  risk  (eg,  individuals
who might come in contact with patients with suspected cases) had
more adverse mental health outcomes than those at high risk  (eg,
individuals  who  worked in infectious wards). The high infection
risk group may be more aware of  the  risk,  have  better  coping
skills,  have  less uncertainty, and have more access to personal
protective equipment and social support.   JAMA  Network  Open  |
Psychiatry  Mental  Health  Symptoms Among the General Population
During the COVID‐19 Outbreak in China Another  prominent  finding
was  the  substantial  impact  of quarantine experience on mental
health, which is consistent with prior studies.28 Quarantine  can
contribute   to   poor   mental   health  in  both  children  and
adults.23,34 People may experience fear  of  infection,  frustra‐
tion,  and boredom during quarantine. Insufficient basic supplies
and disruptions of information flow can increase  both  fear  and
anxiety.28  In the present study, both centralized quarantine and
home quarantine enhanced the odds of adverse mental  health  out‐
comes.  Moreover,  centralized  quarantine can have a more perni‐
cious outcome because of fear of infection, being in an  enclosed
space,  and  being  in an unfamiliar and crowded environment. The
environment plays a vital role in  maintaining  healthy  emotions
and  sleep.35,36  An  unfamiliar and crowded environment may be a
catalyst for the unique association between  centralized  quaran‐
tine  and poor mental health status.  A high probability of symp‐
toms of depression and anxiety was found among people who had not
yet  returned  to  work.  Among  people who had returned to work,
those who worked at home had a higher risk of mental health symp‐
toms compared with those who did not work at home. Being occupied
with work activities can serve as a distraction from epidemic‐re‐
lated  information.   Interpersonal  interactions that occur with
conventional styles of work, in contrast to working at home,  can
ameliorate  depression  and  lower  the  risk  of  mental  disor‐
ders.37,38 Our results imply that accelerating peoples return  to
normal work may have a positive influence on mental health.  Some
demographic factors may also influence mental health  during  the
COVID‐19  pandemic.  Unmarried status and lower income were iden‐
tified as risk factors for poor mental health outcomes, which  is
consistent  with  previous studies.39‐41 However, opposite trends
were observed for gender and age. The  higher  susceptibility  of
male  participants  to  mental health symptoms during the crowded
places or not wearing masks) and higher infective rate.42,43  The
higher  risk  of  mental health symptoms among younger people was
also identified in this study, which is consistent with a to  the
fact  that young adults frequently engage in social media and may
be more exposed to self‐reported history of mental  disorders  in
this  study  was  low, which might be attributed to stigma toward
mental illnesses47 and the low recognition rate of mental  health
symptoms48  in  China. We cannot exclude the possibility that the
representativeness of the sample may influence the proportion  of
self‐reported  mental  disorders.   Strengths and Limitations The
strengths of this study include its extensive geographic coverage
across  China,  large  sample size, and the special study period.
Participants with different demographic and COVID‐19 epidemic re‐
lated  characteristics  were recruited from all 34 province‐level
regions in China. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this
is  the  first  study  that  has  systematically investigated the
prevalence of and factors associated with mental health  symptoms
(ie, symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress)
by standardized rating scales among the general population during
the  COVID‐19  pandemic  in  China. Our findings may provide more
helpful information for policy making, recognition  of  high‐risk
populations, and framework design for population‐specific psycho‐
logical crisis sampling method. Aside from posting our  question‐
naires  on  the  main  Joybuy  website, we also sent proportional
questionnaire links to registered members  to  increase  the  re‐
sponse  rate. Although this study had extensive geographic cover‐
age across China and a large sample size, it was conducted  among
internet users who were young and highly educated; thus, the rep‐
resentativeness of the sample might be limited. Second, the  sta‐
tus  of mental health symptoms was based on the respondents self‐
reports rather than clinical diagnoses. Third, this was a  cross‐
sectional  study.   Therefore, associations between mental health
symptoms and risk factors cannot necessarily be considered causal
relationships. Fourth, the results may only reflect mental health
status during the JAMA Network Open |  Psychiatry  Mental  Health
Symptoms  Among  the  General Population During the COVID‐19 Out‐
break in China epidemic. Follow‐up studies are needed  to  deter‐
mine  the  possible  long‐term  mental health outcomes associated
with the COVID‐19 pandemic.  The prevalence of  symptoms  of  de‐
pression,  anxiety,  insomnia,  and acute stress was high in this
sample of study participants from China during the COVID‐19  pan‐
demic,  especially  among  patients  with  confirmed or suspected
COVID‐19 and their family members and friends, people with  occu‐
pational  exposure risks, and residents of Hubei province. Perva‐
sive intervention measures, including quarantine  and  delays  in
returning  to  work, were closely associated with negative mental
health outcomes. These findings suggest that the COVID‐19 pandem‐
ic  may  have severe mental health repercussions. Population‐spe‐
cific mental health interventions are urgently needed to meet de‐
mand  during  this outbreak. Future studies are needed to explore
the association of the COVID‐19 pandemic with  mental  health  in
other  countries and its long‐term outcomes.  ARTICLE INFORMATION
