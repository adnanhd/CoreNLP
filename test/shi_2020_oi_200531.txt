CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this survey indicate that mental health symptoms
may have been common during the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in China,
especially among infected individuals, people with suspected infection, and people who might have
contact with patients with COVID-19. Some measures, such as quarantine and delays in returning to
work, were also associated with mental health among the public. These findings identify populations
at risk for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and may help in implementing
mental health intervention policies in other countries and regions.
In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred and aroused global
attention.1 It has infected more than 6.1 million people and caused 376 000 deaths worldwide across
216 countries, areas, or territories according to June 3, 2020, data from the World Health
Organization.2 In contrast to previous epidemics and pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory
syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 is more contagious and spreads faster.3
The World Health Organization officially announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic and called
on the whole world to work together to confront this infection.4 Compulsory measures, such as
implemented in China and other countries to impede further escalation of the pandemic.5-8 Facing
this large-scale infectious public health event and these enormous disruptions to daily life, people are
under unprecedented pressure and are experiencing severe psychological distress.9
Few studies have investigated COVID-19related mental health symptoms in the general
population. One pilot study10 in China reported that nearly one-half of the respondents considered
the mental health impact of COVID-19 as moderate or severe, and one-third exhibited anxiety
symptoms. To set priorities for public health policies and implement effective health care
interventions, the prevalence of mental health symptoms and factors that are associated with them
during the COVID-19 outbreak need to be determined urgently. Thus, we conducted a large-sample,
anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress and potential risk factors in the general population in China.

in China. The survey link was posted on the website. We used a convenience sampling method. The
registered members clicked the link on the platform and responded to the survey voluntarily until the
convenience sample covered all 34 province-level regions in China. This was an anonymous survey,
and confidentiality of data was ensured.
Study Population
The respondents were all registered members of Joybuy. A total of 71 227 individuals clicked on the
survey link, and 57 006 individuals commenced the survey, among whom 74 individuals refused to
provide informed consent and 56 932 participants provided informed consent and submitted the
questionnaires. One hundred fifty-six questionnaires that did not provide valid age information were
excluded from the analysis. Ninety-seven respondents who were younger than 18 years were also
present conditions.
Measurements and Covariates
The survey lasted approximately 15 minutes and had 4 parts. The first part gathered demographic
information of the participants, including gender, age, living area (urban vs rural), level of education,
marital status, monthly family income, geographic region, history of chronic diseases, history of
psychiatric disorders, family history of psychiatric disorders, and occupation. The second part asked
epidemic-related questions. The third part evaluated isolation conditions and social attitudes toward
The fourth part of the questionnaire consisted of 4 standardized scales, including the Chinese
versions of Patient Health Questionnaire9,11 Generalized Anxiety Disorder7,12 Insomnia Severity
Index,13 and Acute Stress Disorder Scale,14 which measured symptoms of depression, anxiety,
insomnia, and acute stress, respectively. The total scores of these scales were interpreted as follows:
Patient Health Questionnaire9, normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe (15-27)
depression; Generalized Anxiety Disorder7, normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), and severe
(15-21) anxiety; Insomnia Severity Index, normal (0-7), subthreshold (8-14), moderate (15-21), and
severe (22-28) insomnia; and Acute Stress Disorder Scale, acute stress symptoms (a dissociative
cluster score 9 and cumulative re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal cluster scores 28). In the
present study, cutoff scores of 5 for the Patient Health Questionnaire9, 5 for the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder7 scale, and 8 for the Insomnia Severity Index were adopted to detect symptoms of
depression, anxiety, and insomnia.
In this study, frontline workers are considered to be individuals who directly participated in the
control of COVID-19, covering a wide range of occupations (eg, medicine, research, public health,
media, security work, police, community work, emergency material delivery services, charity,
construction, management, and psychological interventions). Frontline workers were presumed to
have direct contact with patients with COVID-19. They were also presumed to possess personal
protective equipment when they were in contact with patients with COVID-19. People with
occupational exposure risks are individuals who did not necessarily participate in COVID-19 control
but were required to contact people at work and could subjectively conceive of threats of being
infected, including sanitary workers, taxi drivers, and supermarket workers, among others. They
were presumed to be poorly equipped with self-protective measures.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to present demographic data. The prevalence of symptoms of
depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress was calculated using the aforementioned cutoff
scores and reported as the percentages of cases in different populations. The 95% CIs were

produced by the exact binomial methods. 2 tests were used to compare the prevalence of mild-tosevere mental health symptoms in different populations. To explore factors potentially associated
with depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress, unadjusted logistic regression and multiple
logistic regression analyses were performed, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs are presented.
Two-sided Wald tests were conducted to determine whether the ORs in the regression models were
statistically significant. All of the variables that were statistically significant in the unadjusted
regression analysis and those that might convey important information were entered into the
the Supplement. The level of significance was set to P < .05. All of the statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS statistical software version 22 (IBM Corp). Data analysis was performed from
March to May 2020.
Demographic Characteristics
Data from a total of 56 679 eligible participants were included in the final analysis, for a participation
rate of 79.9% (56 932 of 71 227 participants). The participants included in the analysis represented
all 34 province-level regions in China. Of the total sample, 27 149 participants (47.9%) were male, and
the mean (SD) age was 35.97 (8.22) years; 39 468 participants (69.6%) were aged 18 to 39 years. Of
(77.2%) were married. Most of the participants (52 839 participants [93.2%]) lived in urban areas,
and 2352 (4.1%) were from Hubei province (ie, the province most severely affected by COVID-19 in
China). This survey included data from 100 individuals (0.2%) with confirmed or suspected cases of
COVID-19, 219 (0.4%) people who were in close contact with patients with COVID-19, and 9725
(17.2%) frontline workers. Of the total number of respondents, 608 (1.1%) had at least 1 family
member or friend who was infected with COVID-19, 17 587 (31.0%) had at least 1 family member or
friend who was a frontline worker, 16 454 (29.0%) had quarantine experience, 19 754 (34.9%) were
not yet back to work, and 2904 (5.1%) had occupational exposure risks. Additional demographic and

symptoms). Respondents with centralized quarantine or home quarantine experience had higher
risks than those without quarantine experience of having depression (adjusted ORs, 1.33 [95% CI,
1.10-1.61] vs 1.30 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36]), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.75] vs 1.28 [95% CI,
1.23-1.34]), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.95] vs 1.24 [95% CI, 1.19-1.30]), and acute
stress symptoms (adjusted ORs, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.21-1.77] vs 1.29 [95% CI, 1.24-1.35]). Hubei residents
also demonstrated a higher risk than participants from other provinces, with adjusted ORs of 1.42
(95% CI, 1.19-1.68) for depression, 1.54 (95% CI, 1.30-1.82) for anxiety, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.01-1.42) for
insomnia, and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.25-1.79) for acute stress symptoms. Nonetheless, being at work was
associated with a lower risk of having symptoms of depression (adjusted OR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.79-0.91), anxiety (adjusted OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99), and insomnia (adjusted OR, 0.87; 95%
CI, 0.81-0.94). Frontline workers had an elevated risk for insomnia (adjusted OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.001.12) and acute stress symptoms (adjusted OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14), and being a close contact of a
patient with COVID-19 remained statistically significant in the multivariable model of insomnia (1.55;
The present study investigated the prevalence of and factors associated with mental health
symptoms among the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a
nationwide, large-sample survey. Approximately one-quarter (24.4%) to one-third (31.6%) of
respondents exhibited symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress. We also
identified several psychologically vulnerable populations, such as individuals with confirmed or
suspected COVID-19 and their relatives, respondents with occupational exposure risks, those who
experienced quarantine, those who lived in Hubei province, and those who had not yet returned to
work. These findings provide a comprehensive profile of psychological status in the general
population in China during the COVID-19 outbreak and may contribute to developing populationspecific mental health management and intervention strategies.
The prevalence of mental health symptoms in the present study is consistent with the results of
an epidemiological study15 that was conducted in early February 2020 among the general population
in China, which indicated that nearly 35% of the respondents manifested psychological distress
January 2020 found that nearly one-third of respondents experienced moderate-to-severe mental
health outcomes. The prevalence of these mental health symptoms during this period of the
pandemic was higher than before the outbreak, during which rates of moderate-to-severe
depression, moderate-to-severe anxiety, and insomnia in China were approximately 6.0%, 5.3%, and
15.0%, respectively.16-19 The prevalence of psychiatric morbidities during the severe acute
respiratory syndrome epidemic in Singapore was reported to be 22.9%,20 and one-third of people
exhibited psychological distress during the equine influenza outbreak in Australia.21 The prevalence
was in accordance with previous studies of such psychiatric problems during other disasters.22,23
These findings indicate that severe emotional distress occurs among the general population during
public health events and underscore the importance of preventing and treating mental health
problems during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The present study identified several population groups who were likely to develop mental
health symptoms. Compared with uninfected people, those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19
were 2 to 3 times more likely to report mental health symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms of the
4 mental health conditions was high among patients with COVID-19 (depression, 75.0%; anxiety,
71.0%; insomnia, 68.0%; acute stress, 71.0%). This is partially consistent with findings among
patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.24 The higher risk of mental health symptoms

members and friends of patients with COVID-19 were susceptible to mental health disturbances. We
found that nearly 50% of family members or friends of patients with COVID-19 experienced mild-tosevere mental health symptoms. Loved ones experiencing negative outcomes during disasters has
been shown to be a strong catalyst of mental health disorders.26,27 In addition, relatives of patients
with COVID-19 may worry about becoming infected themselves, may be quarantined, and may feel
stigmatized, all of which may exacerbate psychological distress.28,29
The present study also found that people with occupational exposure risks reported greater
symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress. People who work in high-risk
environments often report more fatigue, health worries, and fear.30 COVID-19 may be symptomless
during the incubation period, and its clinical manifestations can be easily confused with those of
normal influenza.31,32 Therefore, people may understandably feel a threat of becoming infected by
being exposed to general patients, thereby affecting their psychological well-being. However, in the
present study, frontline work was not significantly associated with depression or anxiety. A previous
study33 suggested that people at moderate infection risk (eg, individuals who might come in contact
with patients with suspected cases) had more adverse mental health outcomes than those at high
risk (eg, individuals who worked in infectious wards). The high infection risk group may be more
aware of the risk, have better coping skills, have less uncertainty, and have more access to personal
protective equipment and social support.

Another prominent finding was the substantial impact of quarantine experience on mental
health, which is consistent with prior studies.28 Quarantine can contribute to poor mental health in
both children and adults.23,34 People may experience fear of infection, frustration, and boredom
during quarantine. Insufficient basic supplies and disruptions of information flow can increase both
fear and anxiety.28 In the present study, both centralized quarantine and home quarantine enhanced
the odds of adverse mental health outcomes. Moreover, centralized quarantine can have a more
pernicious outcome because of fear of infection, being in an enclosed space, and being in an
unfamiliar and crowded environment. The environment plays a vital role in maintaining healthy
emotions and sleep.35,36 An unfamiliar and crowded environment may be a catalyst for the unique
association between centralized quarantine and poor mental health status.
A high probability of symptoms of depression and anxiety was found among people who had
not yet returned to work. Among people who had returned to work, those who worked at home had
a higher risk of mental health symptoms compared with those who did not work at home. Being
occupied with work activities can serve as a distraction from epidemic-related information.
Interpersonal interactions that occur with conventional styles of work, in contrast to working at
home, can ameliorate depression and lower the risk of mental disorders.37,38 Our results imply that
accelerating peoples return to normal work may have a positive influence on mental health.
Some demographic factors may also influence mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unmarried status and lower income were identified as risk factors for poor mental health outcomes,
which is consistent with previous studies.39-41 However, opposite trends were observed for gender
and age. The higher susceptibility of male participants to mental health symptoms during the
crowded places or not wearing masks) and higher infective rate.42,43 The higher risk of mental health
symptoms among younger people was also identified in this study, which is consistent with a
to the fact that young adults frequently engage in social media and may be more exposed to
self-reported history of mental disorders in this study was low, which might be attributed to stigma
toward mental illnesses47 and the low recognition rate of mental health symptoms48 in China. We
cannot exclude the possibility that the representativeness of the sample may influence the
proportion of self-reported mental disorders.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study include its extensive geographic coverage across China, large sample size,
and the special study period. Participants with different demographic and COVID-19 epidemic
related characteristics were recruited from all 34 province-level regions in China. In addition, to the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has systematically investigated the prevalence of
and factors associated with mental health symptoms (ie, symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia,
and acute stress) by standardized rating scales among the general population during the COVID-19
pandemic in China. Our findings may provide more helpful information for policy making, recognition
of high-risk populations, and framework design for population-specific psychological crisis
sampling method. Aside from posting our questionnaires on the main Joybuy website, we also sent
proportional questionnaire links to registered members to increase the response rate. Although this
study had extensive geographic coverage across China and a large sample size, it was conducted
among internet users who were young and highly educated; thus, the representativeness of the
sample might be limited. Second, the status of mental health symptoms was based on the
respondents self-reports rather than clinical diagnoses. Third, this was a cross-sectional study.
Therefore, associations between mental health symptoms and risk factors cannot necessarily be
considered causal relationships. Fourth, the results may only reflect mental health status during the

epidemic. Follow-up studies are needed to determine the possible long-term mental health
outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress was high in this
sample of study participants from China during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among patients
with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and their family members and friends, people with
occupational exposure risks, and residents of Hubei province. Pervasive intervention measures,
including quarantine and delays in returning to work, were closely associated with negative mental
health outcomes. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have severe mental
health repercussions. Population-specific mental health interventions are urgently needed to meet
demand during this outbreak. Future studies are needed to explore the association of the COVID-19
pandemic with mental health in other countries and its long-term outcomes.
