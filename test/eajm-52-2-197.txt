The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2019-nCoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2)] was first detected in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. In current status, spread of COVID-19 in person-to-person could be caused mainly by respiratory droplets, which leads to the spread of
the influenza virus in both community and clinicians. Thus, in order to reduce the risk of that, the urgent
management strategies against COVID-19 are to block transmission, isolation, protection, and using drug or
vaccine updated on an ongoing basis. unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines still has yet been allowed to treat
patients with COVID-19, so the rapid detection of effective intercessions against COVID-19 is seemed a
of COVID-19, the influence of droplets travel in person-to-person transmission and the effect of wearing
masks in the infection prevention of influenza virus, as well as understanding its advantage and role in the
coronavirus infection prevention.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is one of the hot issues around the
world today. As known, the influenza virus (influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1), severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 viruses) outbreak is a threat to human health, as well as a major challenge for both
community and clinicians [1-4]. For example, health care workers (HCWs) can initially be at
risk and get infected from examining and treating patients with a respiratory infection [5]
and then become indiscreet carriers to other patients, family members, and the community
if they do not regularly wash their hands or take other infection-preventive measures. In
addition, owing to shortages in the availability of antiviral medicine and delays in drug or
vaccine development, respiratory protection is one of the key non-pharmaceutical interventions for protection of both community and clinicians. As such, it is truly necessary for
each individual in the community and for clinicians to use personal respiratory protective
methods to prevent infection of the influenza virus. Therefore, currently, handwashing and
wearing masks are one of the ways of preventing infection of the influenza virus. However,
currently, there are gaps in the knowledge about the prevention of influenza virus by wearing masks (cloth masks, medical masks, N95 respirators, and surgical masks). Hence, this
paper aims to introduce the characteristics of COVID-19, the influence of droplet travel
in person-to-person transmission, and the effect of wearing masks in COVID-19 infection
Characteristics of COVID-19
To date, the emergence and rapid transmission of COVID-19 from patients with severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China, has become a global health concern [6-9]. The features of COVID-19
are similar to those of SARS (or MERS), which is known as a single-stranded RNA b-coronavirus
genome with enveloping and positive-sense, ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length [10],
as well as encoding non-structural, structural, and accessory proteins. Fever, fatigue, and dry
cough are considered symptoms of COVID-19. Sometimes, there are a few patients with mild

To further understand its characteristics, Huang
et al. [9] and Chan et al. [14] showed the multifocal ground-glass changes in the chest and
1) that are typical of viral pneumonia. One of
the disease development features is the bilateral
multiple lobular and sub segmental areas of consolidation found in the chest CT scan. Besides,
in CT scan images, the lungs of older patients
were further diffused and found to be wider
than those of the younger patients [11, 14]. According to some references for the source of
the COVID-19 emergence, most of the infected patients were associated with the seafood
wholesale market in Wuhan, China [9], or the
COVID-19 virus penetrated into the market
place before it spread from there [15]; however, the spread of COVID-19 remains largely
unknown. Transmission of COVID-19 could be
airborne or human-to-human contact; however,
both aerosol and fecal-oral transmission still remain unclear [13]. To date, critical public health
measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 include quarantine both in community
and clinicians, as well as timely diagnosis (through
testing kits, etc.) and strict participation to prevent the spread of the virus in health care settings [16]. Furthermore, lessons from the influenza virus (H1N1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV)
outbreak also support to effectively prepare for
COVID-19 outbreak [17].
Wearing Masks to Prevent COVID-19 Infection
Influence of droplet travel in person-toperson transmission
As known, reducing transmission of the influenza virus in both community and clinicians
may not only help support them but also prevent person-to-person transmission during an
influenza virus pandemic. For other protective
strategies, drugs or vaccines may be limited in

availability. Thus, it is truly necessary for clearly
understanding the influence of droplet travel in
person-to-person transmission to support the
COVID-19 infection prevention. Transmission
of COVID-19 could be airborne or through
contact, especially large droplets and airborne
routes are credited to person-to-person transmission, which could be the cause of a large
number of influenza infections, as well as travel
of droplets, which involves traveling of droplet-
symptoms and then patients gradually start experiencing aches, nasal congestion, runny nose,
sore throat, or diarrhea. Several people who are
infected do not develop any symptoms; in particular, older adults and people with underlying
medical diseases (diabetes, heart problems, or
high blood pressure) are prone to experience
serious symptoms, especially those with a history of close contact with COVID-19-infected
patients and a history of travel to Wuhan, China.
The period of incubation is generally 37 days
of 14 days [11]. For example, a 65-year-old Chinese man was admitted to Cho Ray Hospital in
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam [12] and a 35-yearold man was referred to an urgent care clinic
in Snohomish, Washington, USA [13], both had
cough and fever during the last four days of the
incubatory period.

borne diseases that can transmit from one person to another. A typical example for travel of
droplets is sneezing, which is seen as an exhalation mode with common respiratory symptoms;
in particular, respiratory infectious symptoms
could create mucus and stimulate various nerves
within the nasal mucous membranes and lead to
a sneeze. However, the mechanism of the biological dynamics of a sneeze is a little different
from that of other respiratory activities. According to some references, the velocity of the
exhaled air in sneezing is much larger than that
of breathing and coughing [18-20], and the created total number of droplets during the sneeze
is also larger than that of other respiratory activities [21]; one can refer to some references of
the distribution of size of droplets produced by
a cough [22-24], a sneeze [25-27], speech [24,
28, 29], and a breath [24, 30-33], and the concentration and number of droplets [34-36].
considered to be on the basis of relative humidity, air speed, and respiratory jets, which could
be the result of their evaporation and movement from expulsion during respiratory activities. Specifically, Xie et al. [37] calculated both
lifetimes and size changes of a droplet, as well as
how far the droplets travel. The results showed
that the droplets with the largest size possible
completely evaporate before falling 2 m away
(60-100 m); these droplets are moved further
(i.e., >6 m [n=50 ms-1] in sneezing, >2 m [n=10
ms-1] in coughing, and <1 m [n=1 ms-1] in breathing). It is really important to develop measures
of effective engineering control for the prevention of respiratory infectious symptoms, as well
as to explore the person-to-person transmission mechanisms involving travel of droplets of
infectious diseases. The results suggested that
the rapid evaporation of small droplets and the
quick falling of larger droplets on the ground
or on surfaces, as well as horizontally deported
large droplets could also travel a long distance.
Moreover, these droplets could be suspended
in the air with low relative humidity conditions,
which can lead to the increase in the possibility
of subsequent inhalation. Thus, an understanding of the travel of droplets has been significant
for developing measures of effective engineering control in the prevention of COVID-19 infection and in exploring the person-to-person
transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases.
However, respiratory protection demonstrates
that aerial transmission is one of the assumed
methods of transmission of the influenza virus
[39]. The results of trials confirmed that only
large droplets are discovered close to the pa-
Vo et al. Wearing Masks in COVID-19 Infection Prevention
sizes could be found at short distances from the
patient, and aerosolized transmission could also
occur at a close distance [41].
Finally, the main transmission of COVID-19 is
related to the droplets created when a person
breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. When the
droplets travel, they get suspended in the air
and quickly fall on the ground or on surfaces.
Besides, anyone can become infected with the
virus because of breathing within 1 m of personto-person distance as well as touching a contagious surface followed by touching eyes, nose, or
mouth without washing hands.
Effect of Wearing Masks in COVID-19 Infection
There are some randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), which are not only based on
handwashing [43-45] but also on wearing masks
(cloth masks, medical masks, N95 respirators,
and surgical masks) both in community and clinicians [46-49]; however, the trials of wearing
masks for respiratory protection are limited, and
the effect of wearing masks in the COVID-19 infection prevention is not yet clearly understood.
As known, the influenza spread could occur by
could be inhaled with a range of 0.1-100 m
[50-55]; thus, the personal respiratory protective equipment is really needed to prevent or
limit the influenza virus outbreak. Besides, N95
respirators could be unavailable in many countries at short notice of a pandemic; therefore,
it is truly important to understand clearly the
relative effectiveness of personal respiratory
protective equipment. So far, there are a few
comparative studies of personal respiratory
protective equipment [46,47] and data comparing the surgical mask with the N95 respirator
among HCWs [56,57]. Although N95 respirators are not regularly suggested for seasonal
influenza, they could play a role in personal
protection against the influenza virus pandemic
(H1N1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 viruses).
The result indicates that HCWs wearing surgical masks are not prone to experience influenza
compared with those wearing N95 respirators
while treating patients with influenza. There
are trials for personal protection against respiratory infections, for example, MacIntyre et al.
[58] performed RCTs to investigate the effect
of medical masks and N95 respirators, proving
that N95 respirators provided superior protection against infections of droplet transmission.
Besides, to ensure safety and health of HCWs,
the superiority of respirators in preventing re-
spiratory infections are also included in infection
control guidelines. Currently, there are only five
of a common ground around the effect of two
kinds of masks (medical masks and N95 respirators) for HCWs against influenza [48, 59-62].
Although N95 respirators have been displayed
as superior than medical masks in preventing influenza respiratory infection, there are still no
studies that examined the laboratory-confirmed
influenza. In other smaller trials, it was found
that there is no increase in respiratory diseases
between HCWs while wearing medical masks
[59]. Besides, there is only one small-scale RCT
that compared medical masks and N95 respirators in HCWs [48], concluding that there is
no difference, but there is a lack of an arm of
controlling. Although medical masks were not
designed to provide respiratory protection [63],
with lower filtration efficiency, they were designed specifically for personal protection [6466]. Moreover, they were designed to prevent
wound contamination for the surgeon [67-69].
Thus, these large-scale RCTs were also unable to
demonstrate any differences between the two
kinds of masks in the influenza infection [60, 61].
A recently conducted trial identified the effect
of cloth masks compared with medical masks,
concluding that cloth masks could increase the
risk of infection in HCWs [62]. In addition, the
period of wearing the disposable mask, extent
to which it protects, and invention of reusable
masks should be researched further.
Overall, in the current COVID-19 outbreak,
infection of the influenza virus. However, there
are several important limitations of the RCTs,
including the lack of performed measures during the study period and non-collection of data
regarding the frequency of device changing [70].
If everyone wears masks, we cannot differentiate between those who are unwell by observing that they are wearing masks. Recently, the
World Health Organization suggested that people with respiratory symptoms and those who
care for people with symptoms should wear
masks [71]. It is truly important to wear and
remove masks correctly to reduce the personto-person transmission of COVID-19 as well as
to ensure correct fit of the mask so that it covers the nose and mouth properly [72, 73]. We
should use soap with water (or warm water) or
hand sanitizer for handwashing, and make sure
that the mask covers the nose, mouth, and chin
there are no gaps, and we should avoid touching
or adjusting the masks during use. Similar measures are taken while removing a mask, with few
200  Vo et al. Wearing Masks in COVID-19 Infection Prevention
differences: untie the bottom tie of the mask,
then remove top tie and remove the mask from
the face; the mask must be discarded immediately and cannot be reused. Handwashing is the
final step. Moreover, older adults and people
with underlying medical conditions are recommended to wear masks, if available.
In summary, to develop effective measures of
prevention to control infectious diseases in
both community and clinicians, it is necessary
to understand clearly the knowledge about
prevention of the influenza virus. Because the
COVID-19 pandemic is worsening by the hour,
individuals need to rapidly respond to this risk.
Washing hands diligently, covering coughs, and
avoiding crowds and close contact are measures
to avoid the risks of transmission in the community. Wearing masks routinely is especially
recommended for all individuals to prevent exposure in the community before the vaccine is
invented. Therefore, isolation, handwashing, and
preventing the spread of the virus are the practical strategies used to tackle the spread of COVID-19. In addition, respiratory protection by
wearing masks is one of the methods to prevent
infection of the influenza virus; however, trials
related to COVID-19 are limited. In addition,
the period of wearing the disposable mask, the
level of protection of masks, and the invention
of reusable masks should be researched further.
