Age, sex and presence of comorbidities are risk factors associated with COVID-19.
Hypertension, diabetes and heart disease are the most common comorbidities in patients
with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of patients with
comorbidities who died of COVID-19 in Brazil. Searches of data were carried out on the
method was used to calculate the prevalence of patients with comorbidities who died. From
the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil until May 20, 2020, 276,703 cases of COVID-19 were
notified in Brazil, 6.4% died, 58.6% of whom were male. The prevalence of comorbidities
among deaths was 83% (95% CI: 79 - 87), with heart disease and diabetes being the most
prevalent. To our knowledge, this study represents the first large analysis of cases of patients
with confirmed COVID-19 in Brazil. There is a high prevalence of comorbidities (83%)
among patients who died from COVID-19 in Brazil, with heart disease being the most
prevalent. This is important considering the possible secondary effects produced by drugs
such as hydroxychloroquine.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has infected more than
seven million people worldwide in 216 countries, and, until Jun 16, 2020, it had
caused over four hundred thousand deaths1. Its etiological agent is the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), transmitted by contact with an
infected person or contaminated fluids2,3.
A multicenter cohort study showed that gender and advanced age are
significantly correlated with COVID-19 and these findings are consistent with the
higher incidence among older people and men4. Another study observed that the
presence of any comorbidity increases the patients risk of developing respiratory
distress, possibly leading to an intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and/or
death5,6. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease are among the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19
In Brazil, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on February 26,
20208, and the first known death was reported 20 days later, on March 17. Until
Pachiega et al.
June 21, the country had confirmed 1,073,376 cases and
50,182 deaths, with an incidence of 5.08 cases per million
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of patients
with comorbidities that died of COVID-19 in the Brazilian
Federative Units.
Data were extracted from the bulletin on the
epidemiological situation of COVID-19, made available
by each of the 26 Brazilian States and the Federal District,
on their official websites. The obtained data were evaluated
according to the following variables: confirmed cases,
ICU hospitalizations and deaths. The epidemiological and
clinical profiles of the deaths cases were also described,
considering sex, age, and the presence and type of
comorbidities, respectively.
Because not all States reported the presence of
comorbidities in fatal cases, the random-effects model to
estimate the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in deaths
and their respective confidence intervals (CI) of 95%, was
used. The heterogeneity of prevalence was analyzed by State
using the Higgins test (I2), which presents the percentage
of variation across them. These analyses were performed
using the Stata statistical software, version 12 (Stata Corp
LLC, Texas, USA).
Data collection from the official websites of each State
Health Department took place from the beginning of the
pandemic in Brazil to May 20, 2020. During this period, we
found 276,703 reported cases of COVID-19, among which
11,278 (4.8%) were admitted to ICU, and 17,752 (6.4%)
cases resulted in deaths.
When analyzing ICU hospitalization percentage by
State, Rio de Janeiro (23.3%) and Minas Gerais (19.6%)
The States with the highest death percentages were:
Rio de Janeiro (10.7%), Para (9.4%), Sao Paulo (7.8%),
Pernambuco (8.1%), Amazonas (6.9%) and Parana (5.2%).
Regarding the epidemiological profile of fatal cases,
22 States segregated a total of 7,531 cases by sex, of which
58.6% were male and 41.4% female. The age of the death
cases was reported only in epidemiological bulletins of
25 States. From 17,752 cases of death, only in 14,728
(83%) the age was reported, the population over 60 years
the clinical profile was only reported in 2,116 deaths (12%)
from 15 States, 1,768 of which presented comorbidities,
The clinical descriptions of the comorbidities in the
death cases were extracted from the epidemiological
bulletins of each State, which reported diseases grouped
according to: Chronic Heart Diseases, Diabetes, Chronic
Lung Diseases (including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease and asthma), Chronic Kidney Diseases, Stroke,
Hypertension, Obesity, Immunosuppressive Diseases,
Chronic Liver Diseases, Cancer, Digestive System Diseases,
Pneumonia, Hematological diseases, Tuberculosis,
Metabolic Diseases (different than diabetes), Smoking
habit, Others (not specified).
Among the cases of death, that showed one or more
previous diseases, a total of 14,737 comorbidities were
recorded. The most prevalent comorbidities found were:
35% chronic heart diseases, 28.7% diabetes, 8.2%
chronic lung diseases (including asthma and Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), 5.9% kidney diseases,
5.3% stroke, 5.1% hypertension, 4.4% obesity, and 3.8%
To our knowledge, this study represents the first large
analysis of cases of sequentially patients with confirmed
COVID-19 in Brazil. By June 21, 2020, Brazil was the
second country in number of confirmed cases of COVID-19,
reporting over a million cases of confirmed COVID-19 and
our analysis included approximately a quarter of these cases.
As in different parts of the world, a higher prevalence in
men and people aged 60 years or in elderly people were
found among deaths by COVID-199-11.
We found that 4.8% of COVID-19 patients were
admitted to ICU, a percentage comparable with a previous
study conducted in the United States of America (USA)
that analyzed 74,439 COVID-19 patients, among whom
1.4% required ICU12. Data collected from 138 patients in
China showed that 26% were admitted to ICUs13. Thus,
States such as Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, with the
highest hospitalization percentages in the country (23.3%
and 19.6%, respectively), should strengthen measures to
avoid the collapse of their hospitals intensive care units.
By June 21, 2020, Brazil has exceeded 50,000
deaths, a mark, so far, reached by only two countries
worldwide. Considering that, Rio de Janeiro, Para, Sao
Paulo, Pernambuco, and Amazonas, which present higher
percentages than that calculated for the overall country,
represent a great national concern. When dealing with the
COVID-19 pandemic, mortality, as well as establishing
priorities for controlling it, is the most important concern.

The capacity of the healthcare system thus becomes a major
issue, especially considering that the number of confirmed
cases in communities is rapidly increasing, as is the case
in Brazil.
The pooled prevalence of comorbidities in deaths
by COVID-19 in Brazil was 83% (95% CI: 79  87).
Previous studies conducted in Korea (90.7%) and China
(68.2%) warned about a higher prevalence of severe
acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2
among patients with comorbidities11,14. They also point
hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes as the
main comorbidities among deaths by the disease. Several

studies suggest that hypertension is the most common
comorbidity in COVID-19 patients15. Likewise, a metaanalysis carried out recently by our team showed that
hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity among
deaths from COVID-19, followed by diabetes and chronic
heart diseases ranking third16. Now, in Brazil we found
that the main comorbidities among deaths are chronic
heart diseases and diabetes. The third most common
comorbidity were the chronic lung diseases, followed by
chronic kidney diseases, stroke, hypertension, obesity
and immunosuppressive diseases which may include HIV
infection and organ transplant patients.

the epidemiological situation of COVID-19, which each Brazilian
state makes available on its official websites.
The epidemiological bulletins of each State do not
specify what were the chronic heart diseases of patients
who died from COVID-19, although this group may
include patients with coronary heart disease, arrhythmias,
infarction, patients with pacemakers and others. Our
results showed that this group of comorbidities was the
most important in the population studied, and this is an
important finding, because the Ministry of Health defends
the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19.
A recent study claims that some cardiac manifestations,
such as cardiac arrhythmias, and even conduction
disorders without repercussion, may represent the initial
manifestations of toxicity related to chloroquine or
hydroxychloroquine17. Therefore, the use of these drugs
can lead to serious complications and even death in
patients with previous heart disease. On the other hand,
the use of these drugs as post exposure prophylaxis (PEP),
has also proved unsuccessful18.
Some difficulties to develop this study were found.
Firstly, not every Health Department updates their
epidemiological bulletins daily, so the updating of data on
a daily basis was unfeasible. Secondly, the epidemiological
bulletins were not standardized, not all of them provide
epidemiological data such as age, nor clinical data such as
the presence of comorbidities, which impaired the collection
of complete data. Thirdly, many epidemiological bulletins
provide information only as graphics and the absolute
numbers were lacking, hampering data replication. Finally,
each Secretariat reported different age groups, which
impaired the comparisons among them.
We concluded that there is a high prevalence of
comorbidities among deaths by COVID-19, affecting
mainly men aged over 60 years. The group of chronic
heart diseases and diabetes were the main comorbidities
among these patients and this is relevant considering
the possible adverse effects produced by drugs such as
hydroxychloroquine. On the other hand, we recommend
conducting studies based on medical records analyzes, with
the purpose of knowing specifically the proportion of each
heart disease in patients affected by COVID-19.
Acknowledging such factors may help to better defining
the risks of death among these COVID-19 patients,
enabling a more targeted and specific approach to avoid
probable deaths. In a scenario without effective antivirals
or vaccines available, governments should apply continuous
countermeasures for different pandemic situations to reduce
mortality, especially in States with high percentages of ICU
hospitalization and deaths.
