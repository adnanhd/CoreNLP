Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented worldwide
health problem that requires concerted and global approaches to stop the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that
the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection,
extremely robust intrinsic immune response where interferon-mediated responses are efficient at controlling
SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo virus production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a
productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and
fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.
Coronaviridae is a large family of single-stranded positive-sense
enveloped RNA viruses that can infect most animal species (human as well as domestic and wild animals). They are known to
have the largest viral RNA genome and are composed of four
genera (Cui et al., 2019). Generally, infection by human coronaviruses results in mild respiratory tract symptoms, and they are
known to be one of the leading causes of the common cold (Moriyama et al., 2020; Paules et al., 2020). However, in the last 18
years, we have witnessed the emergence of highly pathogenic
human coronaviruses, including the severe-acute-respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), the Middle-Eastrespiratory-syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, at
the end of 2019, the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-related
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Lu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is
responsible for the coronavirus-associated acute respiratory
disease or coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and represents
a major global health threat, and coordinated efforts are urgently
needed to treat the viral infection and stop the pandemic.
Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets cells of the lung
epithelium, causing respiratory infection, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium can also be infected. Multiple
studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea at the onset of the disease and have detected the prolonged
shedding of large amounts of coronavirus genomes in the feces
et al., 2020b; Xiao et al., 2020; Xing et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020b;
Wolfel et al., 2020). Although one study revealed the isolation of
to date, it remains unclear how many people shed infectious viruses in feces. Most critically, it remains unknown whether or not
there is a possibility for fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but
multiple health agencies worldwide have highlighted this possibility. The presence of such a large amount of coronavirus genomes in feces is hardly explainable by a swallowing virus replicating in the throat or by a loss of barrier function of the intestinal
epithelium, which will allow the release of viruses or genomes
from the inside of the body (circulation or lamina propria) to the
lumen of the gut. Instead, it is likely due to an active replication

in the intestinal epithelium. Recently, intestinal biopsies of
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients clearly show the presence of
replicating viruses in epithelial cells of the small and large intestine (Xiao et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection of the gastrointestinal tract is supported by the fact that ACE2, the virus receptor
(Hoffmann et al., 2020), is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells
(Zhao et al., 2020; Lukassen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Venkatakrishnan et al., 2020), and single-cell sequencing analysis
suggest that its expression is even higher on intestinal cells
compared to lung cells (Xu et al., 2020a). This highlights that
SARS-CoV-2 is not restricted to the lung and also infects the
gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, many animal coronaviruses
are well known to be enteric and are transmitted via the fecaloral route (Wang et al., 2019; Wang and Zhang, 2016). Additionally, the presence of human pathogenic coronaviruses in the
gastrointestinal tract was previously reported for SARS-CoV-1
and MERS-CoV but remained seriously understudied (Leung
et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2017). Although it is
now clear that human coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV-2,
are found in feces and can infect the gastrointestinal tract, the
importance of its enteric phase for viremia, pathogenesis, and
patient prognosis remains unknown.
To combat the current pandemic of COVID-19 and prepare
for potential future emerging zoonotic coronaviruses, we
need to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and de novo infectious virus
production in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we engaged in
studying SARS-CoV-2 infection of human intestinal cells. For
this, we exploited both human intestinal epithelial cell (hIEC)
lines and human organoid culture models to characterize how
these cells support SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo infectious virus production and how they respond to viral infection.
Direct comparison of both primary and transformed cells
shows that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection and
viral infection elicited a robust intrinsic immune response where
interferon (IFN) mediated responses were efficient at controlling
SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo infectious virus production. Importantly, human primary intestinal epithelial cells responded to SARS-CoV-2 infection by producing only type III
IFN. Taken together, our data clearly highlight the importance
of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2, and this should be
taken into consideration when developing hygienic/containment measures and antiviral strategies and when determining
patient prognosis.
in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). First, SARS-CoV-2
(strain BavPat1) was propagated in the green monkey cell line
Vero. To detect viral infection, we used an antibody directed
against a region of the nucleoprotein (N) that is conserved between of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we
used the J2 antibody, which detects double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA), which is a hallmark of RNA virus replication (TargettAdams et al., 2008). Cells positive for N were always positive
for dsRNA; the N signal was found to be dispersed within the
cytosolic area, whereas dsRNA was found in discrete foci likely

and S1D). At different times post-infection, T84 and Caco-2
Similar results were observed in the T84 cells, but detection of
infection was slightly delayed compared to Caco-2 cells, and,
although the same amount of SARS-CoV-2 was used to infect
of hIECs by SARS-CoV-2 was associated with the generation of
an IFN-mediated intrinsic immune response. Concomitant with
the differences observed in virus replication and de novo virus
production observed between T84 and Caco-2 cells, T84 cells
mounted a much stronger immune response than Caco-2 cells
IFN was under the detection limit (data not shown). Altogether,
these results show that IECs are readily infected by SARSCoV-2 and that infection of Caco-2 cells lead to a weaker
intrinsic immune response that is associated with more
de novo infectious virus production compared to T84 cells.
This observation suggests that the IFN-mediated immune
response controls SARS-CoV-2 infection in IECs.
IFN Hinders SARS-CoV-2 Infection in hIECs
To directly test the function of IFNs in controlling/restricting
SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo infectious virus production
in hIECs, T84 and Caco-2 cells were mock-treated or pretreated
with type I (IFN-b1) or type III (IFN-l) IFNs. 24 h post-treatment,

the type III IFN receptor (IFNLR1; LR / ) or depleted of both

either IFN, and the production of the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG)

antibody, and the number of infected cells was quantified using

III IFN receptor (LR / ) resulted in a significant increase of cell
infectivity by a factor of approximately seven. Similar results
were obtained when both the type I and type III IFN receptors
the number of infected cells upon depletion of the type III IFN receptor (LR / ) was associated with a significant increase in viral
SARS-CoV-2 infection in human IECs.
To unambiguously address the importance of the IFN-mediated antiviral response, we used the pan-JAK inhibitor (pyridone-6) to inhibit the STAT1 phosphorylation activation and
block the production of ISGs. As we previously reported, treatment of T84 cells with the pan-JAK inhibitor fully inhibits signal
transduction downstream both the type I and type III IFN receptors (Pervolaraki et al., 2017; and data not shown). Mock-treated
and pyridone-6 pretreated T84 cells were infected with SARSCoV-2 for 24 h and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy
following immunostaining using the anti-N antibody. Results
show both a significant increase in the number of infected cells
agreement with the results observed in cells depleted of the type
III IFN receptor, this increase in infectivity was also associated
where type-III-IFN-mediated signaling controls SARS-CoV-2
infection in hIECs.
Human Primary Intestinal Organoids Support SARSCoV-2 Infection, Replication, and De Novo Infectious
Virus Production
To address whether primary hIECs can be infected by SARSCoV-2 and support de novo virus production, we used humancolon-derived organoids from two distinct donors. Intact ultrastructural organization and differentiation to all cell types (e.g.,

et al., 2020). Nondifferentiated organoids were seeded on human-collagen-coated iBIDI chambers. At 24 h post-seeding, differentiation was induced by removal of Wnt3a and reducing the
amounts of R-spondin and Noggin for 4 days. Upon full differentiation, organoids were infected with SARS-CoV-2. At 24 hpi,
infection was analyzed by immunostaining using the anti-N and

prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, colon organoids were mocktreated or pretreated with IFN-b1 and IFN-l and then subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 h. Results show that
pretreatment of colon organoids with both IFN-b1 and IFN-l
organoids can support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and
de novo infectious virus production and that the type III IFN
response plays a critical role in controlling virus replication.
Increasing numbers of clinical reports detail that COVID-19 patients not only have severe respiratory symptoms but also
show indications of gastrointestinal pathologies. To efficiently
combat the pandemic, it is necessary to fully appreciate the
complexity of the disease, and this requires that the virus life cycle and its interaction with the host are characterized for each
site of infection (e.g., lung versus gut). Here, we report that
hIECs, including primary non-transformed epithelial cells, fully
support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and de novo infectious virus production. Interestingly, infection of primary hIECs
by SARS-CoV-2 induces a robust intrinsic immune response
characterized by the production of type III IFNs, but not type I

IFN. Pretreatment of hIECs with exogenous IFNs prior to SARSCoV-2 infection results in a major drop of the number of infected
cells, a reduction of viral replication, and a significant decrease in
its specific receptor results in a significant increase of SARSCoV-2 replication and secretion. Together, our results demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, and this may have critical implications for the etiology of
both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pathologies observed in
COVID-19 patients. Additionally, our work highlights the central
role of type III IFN in controlling SARS-CoV-2 at the intestinal

agreement with recent work from Lamers et al. showing that
infection of human intestinal organoids by SARS-CoV-2 induces
a strong immune response characterized by a strong expression
of ISGs (Lamers et al., 2020). Interestingly, in this work, expression of type III IFN was shown to be very low. This is contrary to
our data showing high production of type III IFN; however, we
monitored IFN-l2/3 levels, while the other study monitored
IFN-l1 levels. Further work is necessary to address if different
subtypes of type III IFNs are induced by SARS-CoV-2. It is well
known that in vivo intestinal epithelium cells are less immunoresponsive because of the gut microenvironment (e.g., microbiota
and tissue-specific immune cells) and as such they will very likely
show a severely dampened immune response allowing for an
even greater SARS-CoV-2 replication.
Analysis of the single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Colon Atlas revealed that only 3.8% of human colon epithelial cells

not support single-cell analysis and clearly show that ACE-2 is

the single-cell RNA sequencing and classical molecular and
biochemical approaches is likely the results of (1) the sequencing
being not deep enough to detect ACE-2 in individual cells and (2)
RNA expression not necessarily matching the protein expression
levels. These observations highlight that although analyzing data
from single-cell RNA sequencing atlases could be very informative, their findings should be validated in tissues, as they may be
misleading or miss important sites of virus replication.

Human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells produce very large
obtained in Vero cells, which are commonly used to isolate and
replication, and, compared to green monkey cells, Caco-2 cells
and did not show cytopathic effects (Mossel et al., 2005). These
observations that Caco-2 are excellent culture models supporting both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 further highlight the
potentially central role of intestinal epithelial cells in COVID-19
patients. Intriguingly, T84 cells, which are also colon-carcinoma-derived cells, supported SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and de novo infectious virus production but to a much lesser
extent compared to Caco-2 cells. Analysis of the intrinsic immune response generated upon infection of both cell lines revealed that T84 cells are more immunoresponsive than Caco-2
cells. In light of the results obtained by pretreating cells with
exogenous IFNs, we propose that T84 cells, by being able to
mount a stronger and faster immune response than Caco-2 cells,
can better restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model is fully
supported by our IFN receptor knockout T84 cells, in which
virus replication and de novo virus production are drastically
increased to levels similar to the ones observed in Caco-2 cells.
Exogenously added type I and III IFNs induce an antiviral state
in our hIECs, thereby restricting SARS-CoV-2 replication in these
cells. Similar observations were made with type I IFN in Vero cells
(Mantlo et al., 2020). Interestingly, infection of Calu-3 human lung
epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 also seems to mount an immune
response (Lokugamage et al., 2020), whereas in A549 cells, in
ferret models and human lung tissues, SARS-CoV-2 infection
leads to the induction of a restricted and muted immune
response lacking the induction of type I and type III IFNs
(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020). The reason for the
difference in the amount of IFN made upon infection of lung
versus intestinal epithelial cells is currently unclear. Like intestinal epithelial cells (Pervolaraki et al., 2017, 2018; Pott et al.,
2011), lung epithelial cells are normally highly immunoresponsive
and make IFNs upon viral infection (Crotta et al., 2013; Ye et al.,
2019). The lack of IFN in lung epithelial cells following SARSCoV-2 infection might be specific for this virus in this tissue
(Blanco-Melo et al., 2020), as SARS-CoV-1 induces IFN production in infected lung tissue (Chu et al., 2020). Importantly, our
work shows that compared to the airway epithelium, the intestinal epithelium produces a typical antiviral response. This highlights that host-pathogen interaction should be considered in a
tissue-specific manner, as different cellular responses and viral
countermeasures might be established among the lung, gut,
and other organs.
Interestingly, in human colon organoids, we observed that only
type III IFN is made upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, although human intestinal organoids are capable of making both type I and
III IFN upon enteric virus infection (Pervolaraki et al., 2018; Stanifer et al., 2020). The lack of type I induction could be due to a kinetic delay of type I IFN production compared to type III IFN but
this will need to be carefully addressed in further experiments.
Another possibility is that SARS-CoV-2 encodes a specific
antagonist that counteracts the production of type I IFN only.
However, further studies are necessary to prove this novel
concept. Additionally, the observation that the knockout of the
type III IFN receptor leads to a much greater increase of
SARS-Cov-2 infection, replication, and de novo virus production
further highlights the central role of type III IFN in SARS-CoV-2
infection of human intestinal epithelium cells.
We propose that the gut is an active site of replication for
SARS-CoV-2, and this could account for the viremia observed
in COVID-19 patients and the presence of large amounts of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the feces. The origin of the replicating
SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal epithelium is still not clear. To date,
only one paper reported the isolation of infectious virus from
stool samples (Wang et al., 2020). Further characterization of
the SARS-CoV-2 enteric life cycle is necessary to determine
whether the viral infection observed in the gut is due to fecal/
oral transmission or is a manifestation of virus spreading from
the lung to the gut. In the context of the gut we foresee that at
the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hIECs will mount an antiviral
response through the type III IFN signaling pathway. As immune
cells participate in mounting an innate immune response, type I
IFN will be secreted from these cells and will be able to act on intestinal epithelial cells further reinforcing their antiviral state
against SARS-CoV-2. In respect to the severe pathologies
observed in the lung, which are believed to be caused by a cytokine storm, the findings that lung epithelial cells mount a muted
immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the
cytokines are coming from an alternative source. This source
could be from local immune cells or the gastrointestinal mucosa
given the large immune response generated by primary hIECs.
As a matter of fact, many cytokines are released from epithelial
cells toward the lamina propria (tissue side) (Stanifer et al.,
2016) and will quickly enter the circulation to potentially fuel
and promote the inflammation and pathology observed in the

Antibodies and Inhibitors
Mouse monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV NP (Sino biologicals MM05), mouse monoclonal against J2 (scions), mouse monoclonal against E-cadherin (BD Transductions #610181), mouse monoclonal anti-SYP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-17750), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Mucin-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology# sc-15334) were used at 1:500 for immunofluorescence. Rabbit polyclonal
ACE-2 antibody (Abcam) was used at 1:500 and mouse polyclonal actin was used at 1:5000 for western blot. Secondary antibodies
were conjugated with AF488 (Molecular Probes), AF568 (Molecular Probes), CW680 (Li-Cor) or CW800 (Li-Cor) directed against the
animal source. Human recombinant IFN-beta1a (IFNb) was obtained from Biomol (#86421) was used at a final concentration of
2,000IU/mL. Recombinant human IFNl 1 (IL-29) (#300-02L), IFNl 2 (IL28A) (#300-2K)) were purchased from Peprotech and and
IFNl 3 (IL-28B) was purchased from BioMol. All three lambda interferons were combined and were used at a concentration of
100ng/mL each to make a final concentration of 300ng/mL, Pyridone 6 (Calbiochem #420099-500)was used at a final concentration
Viral infections
All SARS-CoV-2 infections were performed the MOI indicated in the text. Media was removed from cells and virus was added to cells
for 1 hour at 37 C. Virus was removed, cells were wash 1x with PBS and media or media containing inhibitors/cytokines was added
back to the cells.
2D organoid seeding
8-well iBIDI glass bottom chambers were coated with 2.5% human collagen in water for 1 h prior to organoids seeding. Organoids
were collected at a ratio of 100 organoids/transwell. Collected organoids were spun at 450 g for 5 mins and the supernatant was
removed. Organoids were washed 1X with cold PBS and spun at 450 g for 5 mins. PBS was removed and organoids were digested

OPEN ACCESS
with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Life technologies) for 5 mins at 37 C. Digestion was stopped by addition of serum containing medium.
Organoids were spun at 450 g for 5 mins and the supernatant was removed and organoids were re-suspended in normal growth
media at a ratio of 250 mL media/well. The collagen mixture was removed from the iBIDI chambers and 250 mL of organoids were
added to each well.
RNA isolation, cDNA, and qPCR
RNA was harvested from cells using RNAeasy RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) as per manufactures instructions. cDNA was made using
iSCRIPT reverse transcriptase (BioRad) from 250 ng of total RNA as per manufactures instructions. q-RT-PCR was performed using
iTaq SYBR green (BioRad) as per manufacturers instructions, TBP or HPRT1 were used as normalizing genes. Primer used:
Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay
Cells seeded on iBIDI glass bottom 8-well chamber slides. At indicated times post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 20 mins at room temperature (RT). Cells were washed and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X for 15 mins at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1h at RT. Cells were washed in 1X PBS three times and
incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 45 mins at RT. Cells were washed in 1X PBS three times and maintained in PBS.
Cells were imaged by epifluorescence on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S (Nikon).
In-cell Western
20,000 Vero E6 cells were seeded per well into a 96-well dish 24h prior to infection. 100uL of harvested supernatant was added to the
first well. Seven 1:10 dilutions were made (all samples were performed in triplicate). Infections were allowed to proceed for 24h. 24h
post-infection cells were fixed in 2% PFA for 20mins at RT. PFA was removed and cells were washed twice in 1X PBS and then permeabilized for 10mins at RT in 0.5% Triton-X. Cells were blocked in a 1:2 dilution of Li-Cor blocking buffer (Li-Cor) for 30mins at RT.
Cells were stained with 1/1000 dilution anti-dsRNA (J2) for 1h at RT. Cells were washed three times with 0.1% Tween in PBS. Secondary antibody (anti-mouse CW800) and DNA dye Draq5 (Abcam) were diluted 1/10,000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1h at
RT. Cells were washed three times with 0.1% Tween/PBS. Cells were imaged in 1X PBS on a LICOR (Li-Cor) imager.
Western blot
At time of harvest, media was removed, cells were rinsed once with 1X PBS and lysed with 1X RIPA (150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0%
Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 with phosphatase and protease
inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 5 mins at room temperature (RT). Lysates were collected and equal protein amounts were separated by
SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane by wet-blotting (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with Li-Cor blocking
buffer (Li-Cor) for one hour at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4 C. Membranes
were washed 3X in TBS-T for 5 mins at RT. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated at RT for 1 hour
with rocking. Membranes were washed 3X in TBS-T for 5 mins at RT and scanned on a Li-Cor scanner.
Supernatants were collected at indicated time points. Virus in supernatants was inactivated with 0,05% beta propiolactone (BPL)
(Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 C. BPL was hydrolyzed at 37 C for 2 hours prior to ELISA. ELISA standards were also diluted in
0.05% BPL overnight following 2h hydrolyzation at 37 C. IFNl2/3 was evaluated using the IFNl2/3 DIY ELISA (PBL Interferon source)
as per manufacturers instructions.
Re-processing of the single-cell RNaseq Human Colon Atlas
having fewer than 500 genes and more than 30% of UMI count mapped to mitochondrial genes were discarded. Consecutively, the
resulting datasets were normalized, scaled and high-variance genes genes were selected. Reciprocal PCA-based data integration
was done to merge the samples. Afterward, the resulting batch-corrected counts were used for calculating PCA-based dimensionality reduction and unsupervised Louvain clustering. Furthermore, UMAP visualization was calculated using 50 neighboring points for
the local approximation of the manifold structure. Cell type annotation was based on the unsupervised clustering and the metadata
provided by the colon atlas (Smillie et al., 2019).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Unless otherwise stated, P values were calculated by a two-tailed unpaired t test using the GraphPad Prism software package. All
samples were analyzed without blinding or exclusion of samples. N values indicate the number of biological replicates for a sample.
