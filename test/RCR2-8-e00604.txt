Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection
was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. We have since seen its fast
spread worldwide. A likely contributing factor was the lack of symptoms of
some of the carriers, making them unaware of their risk of spreading to
other more vulnerable individuals. The other important nding has been
the reported cases of infectivity despite lack of symptoms. We describe the
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patterns in asymptomatic individuals. The common computed tomography (CT) thorax patterns found are peripheral ground-glass opacication (GGO) with upper or lower lobe predominance. We
believe screening for 2019-novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in high-risk individuals may help identify the patients needing longer follow-up.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection was declared a pandemic by the World
Health Organization on 11 March 2020. 2019-Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus
belonging to the -coronavirus cluster. To date, two fatal
respiratory diseases in human history are SARS in 2002 and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012.
Case Series
An asymptomatic 45-year-old woman with no known medical illness was screened for SARS-CoV-2 after travelling back
from Scotland. She tested positive for COVID-19 and was
admitted. Her oxygen saturation was 99% on room air with a
respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute (bpm). Examination of the respiratory system was unremarkable. Chest
radiograph showed bilateral lower zone air space opacities
(Fig. 1A). Her Modied Early Warning Score (MEWS) was
1. We proceeded with a high-resolution computed
tomography (HRCT), which showed bilateral peripheral
lower zone ground-glass opacication (GGO) (Fig. 1B). She
was treated with oral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Chest radiograph ve
days later showed signicant improvement of GGO (Fig.
1C). COVID-19 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was detected at day 10 of illness
and became negative at day 14. She was discharged well.
A 62-year-old asymptomatic man was admitted after testing positive for COVID-19 during contact screening. He
was afebrile with RR of 20 bpm and oxygen saturation of
95% on room air. Chest examination was normal. Chest
radiograph showed left upper zone peripheral consolidation (Fig. 1D). HRCT thorax showed peripheral GGOs
involving both the left upper and right lower lobes
(Fig. 1E). He was treated with HCQ and azithromycin.
The MEWS remained at 1 point throughout admission.
Repeated chest radiograph at day 5 showed resolution of
the GGOs (Fig. 1F).

A 52-year-old asymptomatic woman tested positive during
screening after contact with a COVID-19 individual. She had
a background history of hypertension and was on perindopril
4 mg od. Clinical examination revealed a temperature of
37 C, RR of 16 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room
air. Lung examination was clear. Chest radiograph showed
air space opacities in the right lower zone (Fig. 1G). Her
MEWS score was 2, and HRCT thorax showed evidence of
bilateral lower zone peripheral GGOs (Fig. 1H). She was
initiated on HCQ and azithromycin. She recovered well with

with the majority presenting with an inuenza-like illness

necrotizing encephalopathy [2,3]. Observational studies
have reported up to 12% of transmissions occurring before
the onset of clinical symptoms [4].
SARS-CoV-2 patients can be asymptomatic [5,6]. All three
patients in our case series displayed no symptoms of COVID19 disease despite showing radiological evidence of pneumonia.
With the absence of symptoms, these patients may not have
voluntarily come forward for screening. Screening based on
symptoms alone may miss a signicant amount of asymptomatic COVID-positive patients. Targeted screening in these
patients have allowed immediate isolation from the community and initiation of treatment which may have prevented disease progression and achieved earlier recovery.
The common laboratory abnormalities are lymphopenia,
increased lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated C-reactive
protein [7]. These parameters are non-specic and their
clinical usefulness is limited. These abnormalities may be
related to the cytokine storm in COVID-19 and the
changes are similar to patients with SARS and MERS.
We performed the initial imaging tool of chest radiograph
which showed varying locations of pneumonia (Fig. 1). As
COVID-19 is a novel disease, we chose to proceed with a
HRCT to allow further clarication on the extent of the
pathologies. We found GGO with peripheral distribution and
upper and lower lobes predominance in our patients. Our
ndings are similar with the known initial computed tomography (CT) manifestations of COVID-19 [8]. The most common reported CT ndings are isolated GGO or a
combination of GGO and consolidative opacities [8]. Less
common ndings include interlobular septal thickening,
bronchiectasis, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and subpleural involvement, cavitation and lymphadenopathy [8].
On average, CT ndings are most prominent on day 10 of
illness and improve after day 14 [9].
In a study including nine hospitals from the region of
rate to be higher from studies in Wuhan, the epicentre of
this outbreak, with lower prevalence of death among
patients from outside Wuhan. They also found that older
patients with comorbidities may have a more severe
impact from the disease [11].
All three patients in our report had a negative RT-PCR
test by day 13 of illness. A study reported a median of
36 days from the date of symptoms to the date of rst negative RT-PCR test, with the longest reported at 45 days
from symptom onset [10]. More recent studies have shown
that pharyngeal virus shedding does not equate to infectivity. This shedding appears to peak at day 4 and is the
highest during the rst week of symptoms [12].
This case series describes SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patterns in asymptomatic individuals. The common CT thorax patterns found are peripheral GGO with upper or
lower lobe predominance. We believe screening for
COVID-19 in high-risk individuals is important to see the
extent of pulmonary damage and assess the possible need
for long-term lung function follow-up.
