The COVID-19 death rate in Northeast Brazil is much higher when compared to the national average, demanding a study into the prognosis of the
region for planning control measures and preventing the collapse of the health
care system. We estimated the potential total cumulative cases of COVID-19
in the region for the next three months. Our study included all confirmed
cases, from March 8 until April 28, 2020, collected from the official website
that reports the situation of COVID-19 infections in Brazil. The Boltzmann
function was applied to a data simulation for each set of data regarding different states. The model data were well fitted, with R2 values close to 0.999.
Up to April 28, 20,665 cases were confirmed in the region. The state of Cear
has the highest rate of accumulated cases per 100,000 inhabitants (75.75),
followed by Pernambuco. We estimated that the states of Cear, Sergipe and
Paraba will experience a dramatic increase in the rate of cumulative cases until July 31. Maranho, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piau
showed a more discreet increase in the model. For Bahia and Alagoas, a 4.7
and 6.6-fold increase in the rate was estimated, respectively. We estimate a
substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants
in the region within three months, especially for Cear, Sergipe and Paraba.
The Boltzmann function proved to be a simple tool for epidemiological forecasting that can help planning the measures to contain COVID-19.

In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak related to COVID-19 was reported in the city of Wuhan,
China, and soon spread to other regions 1. Three months later, the World Health Organization raised
the state of contamination and declared it a pandemic due to the rapid geographical spread of the
COVID-19 virus over a short-time scale 2.
Transmission of the etiological agent of COVID-19 occurs mainly through aspiration or contact
with respiratory secretions of infected patients. Efforts to prevent it are being adopted worldwide,
with an emphasis on social isolation of the population by restricting people circulation and grouping
and blocking non-essential services 3,4, closing bars, hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, theaters,
On April 28, 2020, COVID-19 had 3,098,391 confirmed cases worldwide, with 216,160 deaths in
185 regions. The first epicenter of the pandemic in China has substantially reduced the number of
new cases since late February. Progressively, countries in Europe became the next global epicenter,
followed by the United States. Current scenarios with the highest number of confirmed cases are the
United States and Spain, with a total of 1,008,066 and 232,128 cases, respectively. The United States
and Italy lead in number of registered deaths 5.
The epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic changes as the virus spreads to a new country. This
adequate support to those who are sick and on the behavior of the population in respecting the recommended measures 6,7,8. However, cities in Latin America have shown low rates of social isolation,
added to speeches that minimize their importance 9.
On April 28, 2020, no state in Brazil had reached the 63% social isolation rate 10. This factor, as
well as regional inequalities in healthcare, low investment in public health and scientific research, a
high poverty rate and government officials unfavorable to social isolation measures can be considered
aggravating in the dissemination of COVID-19 9,11. Two months after the confirmation of the first
COVID-19 case in the country 12, 71,866 cases and 5,017 deaths 13 were confirmed, overtaking China
in the same period of time and causing concern about the future of the pandemic in its regions.
Currently, the national incidence rate of COVID-19 is 145 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants. The
north of the country faces a public health calamity, with all intensive care beds occupied. The Southeast is the most affected region, considering the number of cases. Despite being outside the current
epicenter of the coronavirus in Brazil, the Northeast Region has a death rate above the national
average and is the second most affected region in absolute cases 13, which makes it important to
study the prognosis of this region for planning control measures and preventing the collapse of the
health system.
The potential of these situations can be estimated through complex mathematical models, such
as those based on susceptible, infectious and recovered data (SIR) 14, and simpler models in terms of
understanding and application, such as the Boltzmann model, already used in studies in China 15,16.
In our study, we estimated the potential total number of cases of COVID-19 in the Northeast Region
of Brazil for the next three months by applying Boltzmann function-based regression analysis.
Design and study area
This epidemiological study used mathematical modeling and geoprocessing techniques. The spatial
units of analysis were the nine states of Northeast Brazil (Alagoas, Bahia, Cear, Maranho, Paraba,
Pernambuco, Piau, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe) 17, distributed over a total area of 1,561,177km2.
Data sources and measures
Our study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection until April 28, 2020. COVID-19 infection was defined as a case with a positive result for viral nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens

or with a positive serological test. This data were collected from the official website 13 that reports the
situation of COVID-19 infections in Brazil. The data for model development were updated on April
29, 2020. The rates of cumulative cases of disease per 100,000 inhabitants were estimated considering
the number of cases in each state divided by the population at risk based on the estimates for the states,
Data analysis
function 15,16,18 was applied to the data simulation for each set of data of the different geographical
regions in Northeast Brazil. We obtained parameters of each function, in which the potential total
number of confirmed cases is given by the parameter A2. The Boltzmann function for future simulation is expressed as follows:
where C(x) is the cumulative number of confirmed cases after the first day x; A1, A2, x0 and dx are
constants. x0 corresponds to the inflection point and indicates the date on which the daily cases will
reach their maximum. After that date, there will be a downward trend in total daily cases; dx is the
adjustment coefficient, indicating the degree of increase in y (number of cases) as a function of the
increase in x (days after the first case). In particular, A2 represents the estimated potential total number
of confirmed cases. A key date (when number of daily new confirmed cases is lower than 0.1% in relation with total cases 16) was included in our study. Data from parameter A2 were used to estimate the
rate of cumulative cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 inhabitants.
Maps were setup with the spread of the cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants of COVID-19
infection using actual and modelled Boltzmann data. Therefore, we used the cartographic base of
Northeast Brazil available in the IBGE electronic database and reported data on COVID-19 infections 17. Terra Datum model SIRGAS 2000 and the cartographic projection corresponding to the
Mercator Transversal Universal system were used. The georeferenced data were incorporated into
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Northeast Brazil were documented in the states of Alagoas
and Bahia on March 8, 2020. Until April 28, 20,665 cases were confirmed across the region. The State
of Cear had the highest rate of accumulated cases per 100,000 inhabitants (75.75) during this period,
followed by the states of Pernambuco (59.89), Maranho (35.73), Rio Grande do Norte (24.44) and
Alagoas (23.28). The lowest rates of cumulative cases were reported by the states of Sergipe (12.18),
Piau (12.46), Paraba (15.75) and Bahia (17.08).
For Boltzmann data analysis, each region was well fitted and all R2 values were close to 0.999
next 150 days after the first case in each state of the Northeastern Region (Alagoas, Bahia, Cear,
Maranho, Paraba, Pernambuco, Piau, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe) were estimated as 5,110
July 3, May 30, June 6, June 16 and June 20, for the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Cear, Maranho, Paraba,
Pernambuco, Piau, Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe, respectively.
The potential number of cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants until May 27, 2020 was estimated for Cear (542.46), Paraba (170.73), Alagoas (150.3), Sergipe (124.04), Pernambuco (107.48),
Bahia (63.29), Maranho (48.86), Rio Grande do Norte (44.54) and Piau (32.26). For July 31,
2020, the potential number of cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants was estimated as 1098.18,
270.05, 153.87, 153.13, 108.45, 79.53, 48.93, 47.39 and 32.73 for Cear, Paraba, Sergipe, Alagoas,

Pernambuco, Bahia, Maranho, Rio Grande do Norte and Piau, respectively. The mapping of the
region shows the states with the potential rates of cumulative cases of COVID-19 over the period
By using data from March 8, 2020 to April 28, 2020 and the mathematical model incorporating these
data, we provided an estimation of the rate of cumulative cases of COVID-19 infection per 100,000
inhabitants in Northeast Brazil for the next three months, specifically for May 27 and July 30, 2020.
We estimated that the states of Cear, Sergipe and Paraba will see a dramatic increase in the rate
of cumulative cases by up to 7.2, 10.4 and 10.8 times in a month and 14.5, 12.6 and 17.2-fold increases
until July 31, respectively. Maranho, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piau were the states
that showed a more discreet increase in the model, with the lowest potential of cumulative case rates
until the end of the estimated period (1.4, 1.8, 1.9 and 2.6, respectively). For the states of Bahia and
Alagoas, 4.7 and 6.6-fold increases, respectively, in the cumulative number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants were estimated for the period.
Knowing the number of infected by COVID-19 is essential to combat the spread of its etiological
agent. However, we must note that our modeling approach did not consider many factors that may
influence the number of cases recorded, along with the current situation of the pandemic. These factors refer to the number of tests made available by health services, the criteria for requesting tests,
which are still restricted to certain cases, and the time spent on acquiring results, diagnoses and notification in the system. Thus, the actual number of cases in the period used for the model in our study
may be even higher. In this context, one study estimated that Brazil could have eleven times more
cases of COVID-19 than those officially registered 19.

In the Northeast Region of Brazil, rapid tests for the serological diagnosis of COVID-19 infection
only started after the second half of April 2020, being offered to a small percentage of the population
with respiratory and flu symptoms, different from what is observed in other countries with a mass
testing strategy 20,21,22. Furthermore, the results of exams made with real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) molecular testing still take many days to be released. These
factors delay the registration of the actual number of confirmed cases and point to a possible reality
of underreporting, since they omit patients with mild symptoms that do not seek health care, asymptomatic individuals or those in the incubation period of infection, who may be potential transmitters
of the virus in the community 23.
Despite the tropical climate predominant in the region, a lower temperature is expected for the
months considered in our study, which may be favorable to the spread of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 24,25,26. This period is also favorable to the emergence of other
common infections in Brazil, such as the common cold, influenza, dengue, Zika and chikungunya,
which can lead to an even greater increase in demand for care and overburden health services.
Another challenge identified for the control of COVID-19 infection in these states are the urban
structure of agglomeration of common communities in the peripheries and the threat of reduction of
social isolation by the population, which has been showing signs of loosening. In the absence of a vaccine and specific treatment for cases of COVID-19 infection, it is strongly recommended and urgent
that individuals of all ages collaborate to slow the estimated progression of the pandemic 27,28 by avoiding overcrowding in hospital services, as well as the exposure of health professionals and more deaths.
Up to April 30, 2020, at least 1,536 deaths from COVID-19 infection have been officially registered in
the Northeast Region of Brazil 17. In addition to the epidemiological health numbers, the adoption of
social isolation, the use of masks and the constant washing of hands by the population may also contribute to low more quickly the economic and emotional impacts caused by this pandemic.
Finally, our study showed that all data sets were well fitted to the Boltzmann function, which
results are based on model assumptions that states that the mechanisms and physical principles that
govern the transmission of infectious diseases and human collective motion must be similar to those
observed in the Boltzmann distribution probability 18. However, successful predictions depend on the
accuracy of the data 18 and it is understandable that the initial data do not reflect the true epidemic,
since testing, identification, diagnostic and counting methods need time and effort to be properly
Another limitation of the methodology used corresponds to the non-linearity or sensitivity 18 to
conditions that may interfere with the future occurrence of COVID-19, since this estimate assumes
that the overall conditions are not changing. Factors related to the host and its behavior, the pathogens ability to survive and the environmental influences can alter the estimate. Besides, the main
advantage of the model used is that it only needs the cumulative number of confirmed cases; this represents a quick method for assisting central and local governments to deal with this emerging threat
at the current critical stage.
Our results estimate a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases of COVID-19 infection per
100,000 inhabitants in Northeast Brazil over the next three months, with an emphasis on the states of
Cear, Sergipe and Paraba. Maranho, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piau showed a more
discreet increase in the modeling. For Bahia and Alagoas, 4.7 and 6.6-fold increases in the rate were
estimated. All data sets were well fitted to the Boltzmann function, which was found to be a simple
tool for epidemiological forecasting that could help planning measures to contain the COVID-19
pandemic. Social isolation measures may be the best strategy to slow the estimated progression of the
infection in the studied period.
