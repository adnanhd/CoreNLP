China.  In December 2019, an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus dis‐
ease  2019  (COVID‐19)  was first identified in Wuhan, China. The
characteristics of COVID‐19 patients treated in  local  hospitals
in  Wuhan are not fully representative of patients outside Wuhan.
Therefore, it is highly essential to analyze the  epidemiological
and  clinical  characteristics of COVID‐19 in areas outside Wuhan
or Hubei Province.  To date, a limited  number  of  studies  have

epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 patients
in Hengyang (China) and provide a reliable reference for the pre‐
vention and control of COVID‐19.  From January  16  to  March  2,
2020,  a total of 48 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 were reported in
Hengyang, and those cases were included in this study. The  diag‐
nostic  criteria, clinical classification, and discharge standard
related to COVID‐19 were in line with the Diagnosis and Treatment
Protocol  for  Novel  Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) re‐
leased by National Health Commission and National  Administration
of  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine. The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in
pharyngeal swab specimens was detected  by  quantitative  reverse
transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction. All the data were im‐
ported into the excel worksheet and statistically analyzed by us‐
ing  SPSS 25.0 A total of 48 cases of COVID‐19 were collected, of
which 1 was mild, 38 were moderate, and 9 were severe. It was un‐
veiled  that  there  were 31 (64.6%) male patients and 17 (35.4%)
female patients, with a female‐to‐male ratio of 1.82:1. The range
of  age  of patients with COVID‐19 was dominantly 30‐49 years old
[25 (52.1%) of 48], followed by those aged over 60 years old  [11
(22.9%)].  Besides,  29.2%  (14 of 48) of patients had basic dis‐
eases, and 57.2% (8 of 14) of patients with basic  diseases  were
aged  over  60 years old. The occupations of 48 COVID‐19 patients
were  mainly  farmers  working  in  agricultural  production  [15
(31.5%)  of 48], rural migrant workers from Hengyang to Wuhan [15
(31.5%)], and service workers operating in the service sector  [8
(16.7%)]. The mean latent period was 6.86  3.57 d, and the median
was 7 [interquartile range (IQR): 4‐9] d. The mean time from  on‐
set  of  symptoms  to  the  first  physician visit was 3.38  2.98
(95%CI: 2.58‐9.18) d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1‐5)  d,  and  the
mean time from hospital admission to confirmed diagnosis was 2.29
2.11 (95%CI: 1.18‐6.42) d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1‐3)  d.  The
main symptoms were fever [43 (89.6%) of 48], cough and expectora‐
tion [41 (85.4%)], fatigue [22 (45.8%)], and chills [22 (45.8%)].
Other  symptoms  included poor appetite [13 (27.1%)], sore throat
[9 (18.8%)], dyspnea [9 (18.8%)], diarrhea [7 (14.6%)], dizziness
[5  (10.4%)], headache [5 (10.4%)], muscle pain [5 (10.4%)], nau‐
sea and vomiting [4 (8.3%)], hemoptysis  [4  (8.3%)],  and  runny
nose [1 (2.1%)]. The numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes, lym‐
phocytes, and eosinophils were significantly reduced in  the  ma‐
jority  of  the  patients. The levels of C‐reactive protein, fib‐
rinogen, blood glucose, lactate  dehydrogenase,  Ddimer,  alanine
aminotransferase  (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma‐
glutamyl transferase (‐GT), myoglobin (MB), and  creatine  kinase
(CK)  were  increased  in  64.6%,  44.7%,  43.2%,  37.0%,  29.5%,
22.9%,20.8%, 21.6%, 13.6%, and 12.8% of  patients,  respectively.
The  incidence  of  ALT elevation in male patients was remarkably
higher than that in females (P < 0.01), while the  incidences  of
AST, CK, and blood glucose elevations in severe patients were re‐
markably higher than those in moderate patients (P  <  0.05,  re‐
spectively).  Except for the mild patients, chest computed tomog‐
raphy showed characteristic pulmonary lesions. All  the  patients
received antiviral drugs, 38 (79.2%) accepted traditional Chinese
medicine, and 2 (4.2%) received treatment of human umbilical‐cord
mesenchymal  stem  cells.  On  March  2,  2020,  48 patients with
COVID‐19 were all cured and discharged.  Based  on  our  results,
patients  with  COVID‐19 often have multiple organ dysfunction or
damage. The incidences of ALT elevation in males,  and  AST,  CK,
and  blood  glucose  elevations in severe patients are remarkably
higher.  Key words: Novel coronavirus pneumonia; COVID‐19;  SARS‐

Core  tip: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteris‐
tics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients with differ‐
ent  genders,  clinical classification, and with or without basic
diseases could provide more information for  COVID‐19  prevention
and  control. Our research found that many patients with COVID‐19
had multiple organ dysfunction or damage. The higher attention of
the  government  and  residents  on the prevention and control of
COVID‐19 was  the  key  factor  to  control  the  development  of
COVID‐19  epidemic. Wearing masks and home isolation could effec‐
tively cut off transmission routes and prevent the spread of  the
novel coronavirus.  Citation: Zhong ZF, Huang J, Yang X, Peng JL,

Clin Cases 2020; 8(12): 2554‐2565 On December 31, 2019, an  unex‐
plained  pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China[1].  It was found
that this pneumonia  was  caused  by  a  2019  novel  coronavirus
(2019nCoV)[2],  which was named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV‐2) by the International Committee on  Tax‐
onomy  of  Viruses.  The  disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 was called
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)[3].  COVID‐19 in  Wuhan,  and
even  throughout  mainland  China; however, from the geographical
perspective, the data were mainly from the  epidemic  centers  of
Hubei  Province, especially Wuhan[4,5]. However, the characteris‐
tics of patients treated in local hospitals in Wuhan are not ful‐
ly  representative  of  patients  outside Wuhan. Therefore, it is
highly essential to  analyze  the  epidemiological  and  clinical
characteristics of COVID‐19 in areas outside Wuhan or Hubei Prov‐
ince. At the same time, there have been limited reports about the
differences  in  the epidemiological and clinical characteristics
of COVID‐19 patients with different genders, clinical classifica‐
tion,  and  with  or  without  basic  diseases.   Since the first
COVID‐19 patient was discovered on January 16, 2020, a  total  of
48  confirmed  cases  of  COVID‐19 have been reported in Hengyang
(Hunan Province), a close neighbor city of Hubei. Until 18:00  on
March  2,  2020,  all  the 48 confirmed cases were cured and dis‐
charged.  At present, COVID‐19 is affecting  many  countries  and
territories  worldwide[6].  The  present study aimed to summarize
the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID‐19  pa‐
tients  in  Hengyang (China) and provide a reliable reference for
the prevention and control of COVID‐19.   MATERIALS  AND  METHODS
Patients  with  COVID‐19  According  to  the  arrangements by the
Hengyang Municipal People’s Government, all the COVID‐19 patients
were  admitted  centrally  to  the  Affiliated Nanhua Hospital of
South China without selectivity. From  January  16  to  March  2,
2020, all the 48 patients with COVID‐19 who were treated at these
two hospitals were included in the current Epidemiological inves‐
tigation  According  to  the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for
Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) released by Nation‐
al  Health  Commission and National Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine[7], the epidemiological history can  be  divided
into  the  following five conditions: (1) History of travel to or
residency in an epidemic area within 14 d prior to onset of  ill‐
ness;  (2)  History of contact with patients with COVID‐19 within
14 d before onset; (3) History  of  contact  with  patients  with
fever  or  respiratory  symptoms  from epidemic areas within 14 d
prior to onset; (4) Zhong ZF et al. Epidemiological and  clinical
characteristics  of  COVID‐19  Agglomeration;  and (5) An unclear
epidemic history.  Diagnosis and treatment The diagnostic  crite‐
ria,  clinical  classification, and discharge standard related to
COVID‐19 were in line with the Diagnosis and  Treatment  Protocol
for  Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)[7].  The pres‐
ence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was  detected  by
quantitative  reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction
(PCR). The SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid diagnostic  kit  (PCR‐Fluores‐
cence  Probing)  was  provided  by Hunan Shengxiang Biotechnology
Co., Ltd. (Changsha, China). This test utilizes the 2019nCoV  ORF
1ab  and  the  specific conserved sequence of the gene coding for
nucleocapsid protein N as the target regions, which were designed
for  the  conserved sequence of the double‐target genes, in order
to detect sample RNA through fluorescent signal changes. The  se‐
quences  are: Target 1 (ORF1ab)[8]: Forward primer, CCCTGTGGGTTT‐
TACACTTAA and reverse primer, ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the  probe
5‐VIC‐CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGBHQG‐1‐3;  Target  2  (N)  [8] :
Forward primer, GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT and reverse primer,  CAGA‐
CATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5‐FAM‐TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT‐TAM‐
RA‐3. Conditions for the amplifications were 50C for 30 min,  95C
for  1  min, followed by 45 cycles of 95C for 15 s and 60C for 30
s. The patients diagnosed with COVID‐19  were  positive  for  the
SARS‐CoV‐2  nucleic acid test, and all the patients released from
isolation and discharged from hospital were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2
nucleic  acid  at least twice.  All the patients received antivi‐
ral, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and symptomatic  therapy
according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coro‐
navirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)[7].  Statistical analysis The
patients  data  were collected or supplemented by interviews with
patients and relatives, and all the data (including epidemiologi‐
cal,  demographic,  clinical,  laboratory, treatment, and outcome
data) were imported into an excel worksheet and statistically an‐
alyzed  by  using  SPSS  25.0  software  (IBM, Armonk, NY, United
States).  All the data were checked by two  physicians  (Huang  J
and Lin HL), and any difference in interpretation between the two
physicians was adjudicated by a third researcher (Yang XF).   Nu‐
merical  variables  are  described using the mean  SD, 95% confi‐
dence interval (95%CI), median,  and  interquartile  range  (IQR)
values.  Categorical  variables  are described as percentages and
were compared using the  2 test. P < 0.05 was considered  statis‐
tically  significant.  Patients demographic characteristics A to‐
tal of 48 cases of COVID‐19 were collected, of which 1 was  mild,
38  were  moderate, and 9 were severe. The mean age of the 48 pa‐
tients was 44.35  15.76 (95%CI: 3.42‐48.24) years  old,  and  the
median age was 41 (IQR: 34.75‐53.75) years old; for moderate cas‐
es, the mean age was 43.95  16.24 (95%CI: 12.64‐75.36) years old,
and  the  median age was 41 (IQR: 11.64‐74.36) years old; for se‐
vere cases, the mean age was 49.11   13.45  (95%CI:  22.54‐75.46)
years  old,  and  the  median  age was 47 (IQR: 38‐65) years old.
Among all the patients, the maximum and minimum ages were 76  and
11  years  old,  respectively.  The range of age of patients with
COVID‐19 was dominantly 30‐49 years old [25 (52.1%) of 48],  fol‐
lowed  by  those aged over 60 years old [11 (22.9%) of 48]. There
were no children who were aged under 10 years old. Besides, 29.2%
(14 of 48) of patients had basic diseases, and 57.2% (8 of 14) of
patients with basic diseases were aged over  60  years  old.  The
prevalence  of  COVID‐19 in patients over 60 years old with basic
diseases was significantly higher than that in  patients  without
basic  It  was  unveiled that there were 31 (64.6%) male patients
and 17 (35.4%) female patients, with a  female‐to‐male  ratio  of
1.82:1. The occupations of 48 COVID‐19 patients were mainly farm‐
ers working in agricultural production [15 (31.5%) of 48],  rural
migrant  workers from Hengyang to Wuhan [15 (31.5%)], and service
workers operating in the service sector [8 (16.7%)]. The patients

had  a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory
symptoms from the epidemic area within 14 d prior to onset; 22.9%
(11 of 48) had clustered onset, which occurred in 10 families and
1 community; 8.3% (4 of 48) of patients had an  unclear  epidemic
history.   Date  distribution  of confirmed cases distribution of
confirmed cases of COVID‐19 by date of onset.  It  was  uncovered
that there were no new confirmed cases in Hengyang after February
14, 2020.  Latent period The latent period  was  defined  as  the
time  from exposure to the onset of symptoms, which was estimated
among patients who could provide the exact date of close  contact
with  individuals  from  Wuhan and other epidemic areas with con‐
firmed or suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The longest latent  pe‐
riod  was 15 days and the shortest was 1 day. The mean latent pe‐
riod was 6.86  3.57 d, and the median was 7 Mean  time  of  first
physician  visit and confirmed diagnosis The mean time from onset
of symptoms to the first physician visit was 3.38   2.98  (95%CI:
2.58‐9.18)  d, with a median of 2 (IQR: 1‐5) d, and the mean time
from hospital admission to confirmed  diagnosis  was  2.29   2.11
(95%CI:  1.18‐6.42)  d,  with  a median of 2 (IQR: 1‐3) d.  Basic
diseases It was uncovered that 29.2% (14 of 48) of  patients  had
basic  diseases (also known as Co‐morbidities), including 2 cases
of coronary disease, 1 case of hypertension, 1 case  of  coronary
disease  with  hypertension, diabetes, and cerebral infarction, 2
cases of diabetes with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, 1 case of
diabetes  with hypertension and gout, and 7 cases of chronic hep‐
atitis B. In the 7 cases of chronic hepatitis B, the serum  mark‐
ers of hepatitis B were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen,
hepatitis B e antibody, and hepatitis B c antibody, 6  cases  had
HBV‐DNA titers < 500 IU/mL, and 1 case had an HBV‐DNA titer > 500
IU/mL. Except for 1 case with elevated Zhong ZF et al.  Epidemio‐
logical  and  clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 alanine amino‐
transferase (ALT) and 1 case with elevated aspartate  aminotrans‐
ferase (AST), the remaining 5 patients had normal liver function,
and 7 patients did not take antiviral drugs.  Symptoms and  signs
The  most common symptoms at the time of admission were fever [43
(89.6%) of 48], cough and expectoration [41 (85.4%)], chills  [22
(45.8%)], and fatigue [22 (45.8%)].  Other symptoms included poor
appetite [13  (27.1%)],  sore  throat  [9  (18.8%)],  dyspnea  [9
(18.8%)],  diarrhea  [7 (14.6%)], dizziness [5 (10.4%)], headache
[5 (10.4%)], muscle pain [5  (10.4%)],  nausea  and  vomiting  [4
(8.3%)], hemoptysis [4 (8.3%)], and runny nose [1 (2.1%)]. At the
time of admission, the mean body temperature was 38.3  0.8 C, and
respiratory  frequency  was  21.17   1.78 times/min. The clinical
symptoms are Laboratory results In the first blood routine exami‐
nation,  the majority [29 (60.4%) of 48] of patients were in nor‐
mal range, and the levels of leucocytes were reduced in about one
third  of  patients  [18 (37.5%)]. Neutrophil count was in normal
range in the majority of patients [38 (79.2%)], and  it  was  de‐
creased  in some [7 (14.6%)] and increased in a limited number of
patients [3 (6.2%)]. The lymphocyte count was reduced in the  ma‐
jority  of  patients  [34  (70.8%) of 48], was in normal range in
about one third of patients [13 (27.1%)], and was elevated  in  a
small  number  of cases [1 (2.1%)]. The eosinophil count was sig‐
nificantly reduced  [48  (100.0%)].   The  liver  function  tests
showed  that  serum  levels  of ALT, AST, ‐GT, and alkaline phos‐
phatase were increased in 22.9% (11 of 48),  20.8%  (10  of  48),
21.6%  (8  of  37), and 5.4% (2 of 37) of patients, respectively.
The abnormal incidence of ALT elevation in male patients was sig‐
nificantly  higher than that in female patients (P < 0.01), while
the abnormal incidence of AST elevation in  severe  patients  was
significantly  increased  compared  with  moderate  patients (P <
0.05). After patients with liver  disease  were  excluded,  there
were 17.07% (7 of 41) of patients with elevated levels of ALT and
AST, and 24.24% (8 of 33) with elevated level of ‐GT.  The  serum
myocardial  enzyme test revealed that the levels of lactate dehy‐
drogenase (LD‐L), myoglobin (MB), and creatine kinase  (CK)  were
increased  in  37.0% (17 of 46), 13.6% (6 of 44), and 12.8% (6 of
47) of patients, respectively. The incidence of abnormal CK  ele‐
vation  in  severe patients was significantly higher than that in
moderate patients (P < 0.05). For renal function test,  some  pa‐
tients  [10 (20.9%) of 48] were found to have increased levels of
uric acid. In terms of fibrinolysis detection, the levels of fib‐
rinogen  and D‐dimer were increased in 44.7% (21 of 47) and 29.5%
(13 of 44)  of  patients,  respectively.  Additionally,  elevated
serum  levels  of C‐reactive protein and blood glucose were noted
in 64.6% (31 of 48) and 43.2% (19 of 48) of patients, respective‐
ly.  Compared  with  moderate patients, the incidence of abnormal
levels of blood glucose was remarkably increased  in  the  severe
patients (P < 0.05). The results Chest computed tomography Except

and interstitial changes in the early stage of lung lesions  were
evident  in  the extra‐pulmonary zone; as the disease progresses,
multiple ground glass shadows and  invasive  lesions  may  illus‐
trates  dynamic changes of chest CT in 1 case of severe COVID‐19.
Treatment effect All the patients received antiviral  drugs,  in‐
cluding  alpha‐interferon (5 million units, atomization; average,
11.2 d), lopinavir/ritonavir (500 mg BID; average,  9.9  d),  ar‐
bidol  (200  mg  TID;  average, 7.8 d), and chloroquine phosphate
(500 mg BID; average, 7.0 d).  Moreover, 38 (79.2%) patients were
given  TCM  based  on  the treatment protocol[7].  Furthermore, 2
(4.2%) patients received treatment of human  umbilical‐cord  mes‐
enchymal  stem cells. A number of patients, mainly those with co‐
infection, were treated with antibiotics including  moxifloxacin,
cefoperazone  sodium,  and sulbactam sodium. Severe patients were
given methylprednisolone (1‐2 mg/kg per day)  and  immunoglobulin
for  3‐5  d. On March 2, 2020, all the 48 patients with confirmed
COVID‐19 were cured and discharged.  Analysis of  epidemiological
characteristics  The outbreak of COVID‐19 in China is roughly di‐
vided into three phases[9,10]. The first  phase  occurred  before
the end of December 2019. COVID‐19 mainly caused a local outbreak
among people who had contact with seafood markets. In early Janu‐
ary 2020, the second phase commenced, with clusters of disease in
multiple communities or  families  in  Wuhan  and  human‐to‐human
transmission  among close contacts[10,11]. In mid‐to‐late January
2020, with the approach of the Spring Festival, personnel mobili‐
ty  increased,  and the third phase of outbreak appeared. At this
time, the epidemic spread from Hubei Province to other  provinces
in mainland China[10].  Hengyang (Hunan Province), a close neigh‐
bor of Hubei Province, began to have an outbreak  in  mid‐January
2020,  just  before  commencing the traditional Chinese New Year.
The first case of COVID‐19 onset was found on January  16,  2020,
and  the  onset  occurred 2 d after he contacted with people from
Wuhan. The distribution of confirmed cases of COVID‐19 by date of
onset  in  Hengyang  was  mainly concentrated from mid‐January to
late‐January. No new cases were found in Hengyang after Zhong  ZF

February 14, due to non‐pharmacological interventions adopted  in
China,  including  wearing masks and home isolation, which effec‐
tively cut off the transmission route of the virus.  None of  the
patients  in Hengyang had a history of wild animal contact within
14 d, excluding the possibility of animal infection. Approximate‐
ly  58.3% of the patients had a history of travel or residency in
the epidemic areas of Wuhan 14 d before  onset,  indicating  that
the early cases of Hengyang were introduced from Wuhan; 31.3% had
no contact with the epidemic areas within 14 d, while there was a
clear  history  of  contact with the patients infected with SARS‐
CoV‐2. Besides, 22.9% had clustered onset, of which  10  were  in
family  and  1 in community. The characteristics of the clustered
onset are similar to  those  of  other  regions  in  China[9,10].
Among the 48 COVID‐19 patients, the mean time from onset of symp‐
toms to the first physician visit was 3.78  2.98 d, and the  mean
time  from  hospital  admission  to  confirmed diagnosis was 2.29
2.11 d, which was shorter than the time reported in  the  litera‐
ture[9,10]. These are closely related to the government and resi‐
dents attaching great importance to the prevention and  treatment
of COVID‐19 and technological advancements in health care.  Anal‐
ysis  of  clinical  characteristics  Totally,  48  patients  with
COVID‐19  were  enrolled,  of which 1 was mild, 38 were moderate,
and 9 were severe. Compared with patients who were initially  in‐
fected  with  SARS‐CoV‐2 in Wuhan[11], the severity of illness of
patients in Hengyang was relatively mild.  The common symptoms of
patients  with  COVID‐19  in Hengyang were fever, cough, fatigue,
and chills. Approximately 10.4% of patients did  not  have  fever
and were easily ignored in the daily temperature screening. Symp‐
toms of the upper respiratory tract were rare, with only  1  case
of runny nose, which was favorable for distinguishing the disease
from the upper respiratory tract. One patient  had  no  symptoms,
positive signs, or changes in chest CT before and after hospital‐
ization, and only SARS‐CoV‐2  nucleic  acid  test  was  positive,
which  was  called  asymptomatic novel coronavirus infection. The
literature has reported that  asymptomatic  patients  with  novel
coronavirus  infection  are  also  highly  infectious[6]. Wong et
al[12] found that SARS‐CoV‐2 can be prevented through  basic  in‐
fection  control  measures,  including  wearing of masks, washing
hands, and environmental hygiene.  Zhong ZF et al.  Epidemiologi‐
cal and clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 could be observed in
the lower lobe of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe,  and
consolidation  was  observed  in the lower lobe of both lungs, as
well as consolidation of the right lung; B: On day 18 of  disease
onset, the consolidation of the lower lobe of both lungs was sig‐
nificantly reduced, and the structure was distorted. The consoli‐
dation  of the lobe and ground glass was mixed; C: An obvious re‐
duction in consolidation of both lungs and increased ground glass
opacities in the lower lobe of the left lung could be observed on
day 23 of disease onset; D: An obvious absorption  and  decreased
density  of bilateral lung lesions, mainly ground glass opacities
and fiber strand shadow distribution, as well  as  bronchiectasis
of  the  lower  lobe of both lungs could be observed on day 31 of
disease onset.  The laboratory tests showed the  following  find‐
ings:  First, the numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes, lympho‐
cytes, and eosinophils were significantly reduced, especially the
number  of eosinophils, which was remarkably decreased in all the
patients. Second, it was revealed that the levels  of  ALT,  AST,
and  ‐GT  were  increased in 22.9%, 20.8%, and 21.6% of patients,
respectively. At present, it is believed that  COVID‐19  patients
suffer  from dysfunction or injury in multiple organs of the body
due to the following three reasons: First, the novel  coronavirus
directly  damages  the  targeted  organ[13‐15]; second, the novel
coronavirus induces systemic inflammatory immune response in  the
human  body[5];  third,  toxic and side effects of some drugs are
important during the course of COVID‐19  treatment[16].  However,
further  research  should  be conducted to confirm the above‐men‐
tioned findings.  Except for one mild patient, the other  47  pa‐
tients  had  morphological characteristic of pulmonary lesions on
chest CT, which plays a pivotal role in diagnosing COVID19[17]  .
The  pandemic  of  COVID‐19  caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 presents an un‐
precedented challenge to identify effective drugs for  prevention
and treatment[18]. The patients in the present study were treated
with a combination of Western medicine and TCM.  None of  the  38
ordinary  patients  got  worse  and became severe, and all 48 pa‐
tients were cured and discharged. In  the  absence  of  effective
drugs  for  COVID‐19[18], TCM is a helpful treatment option.  The
current study was limited by a number  of  factors  that  require
further  attention.  First, a small number of COVID‐19 cases were
involved in this study. Second, laboratory examination results of
a  number  of patients were missed, resulting in incomplete data.
In conclusion, compared with  patients  initially  infected  with
SARS‐CoV‐2  in  Wuhan,  the symptoms of patients with COVID‐19 in
Hengyang are relatively mild, and the mean  time  from  onset  of
symptoms to the first physician visit and the mean time from hos‐
pital admission to confirmed diagnosis are shorter. COVID‐19  pa‐
tients  in  the  present research have the following characteris‐
tics: First, in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, there
are  other systemic symptoms; second, the numbers Zhong ZF et al.
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID‐19  of  pe‐
ripheral  blood leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils are sig‐
nificantly reduced, especially the number of  eosinophils,  which
is reduced in all the patients; third, some morphological charac‐
teristics of pulmonary lesions appeared in  the  chest  CT  scan;
fourth,  laboratory  tests revealed multiple organ abnormality or
damage. Our outcomes  may  assist  clinicians  in  diagnosis  and
treatment of COVID‐19.  ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS Research background At
present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is  influencing  210
countries  and  territories worldwide, which is becoming a severe
public health concern.  Research motivation There have been  rare
reports about the differences in the epidemiological and clinical
characteristics of  COVID‐19  patients  with  different  genders,
clinical classification, and with or without basic diseases.  Re‐
search objectives To study the differences in the epidemiological
and  clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 patients with different
genders, clinical classification, and with or without basic  dis‐
eases,  and  provide  a reliable reference for the prevention and
control of COVID‐19.  Research methods From January 16  to  March
2,  2020, a total of 48 confirmed cases of COVID‐19 have been re‐
ported in Hengyang and were included in this study. All the  data
were imported into the excel worksheet and statistically analyzed
by using SPSS25.0 software.  Research results The  main  symptoms
of COVID‐19 patients in Hengyang were fever, cough and expectora‐
tion, fatigue, and chills, and there were multiple organ dysfunc‐
tion or damage, such as reduced peripheral blood leukocytes, lym‐
phocytes, and eosinophils, and increased C‐reactive protein, fib‐
rinogen, blood glucose, LD‐L, D‐dimer, ALT, AST, ‐GT, MB, and CK.
Except for the mild patients, chest CT showed pulmonary  lesions.
On  March  2,  2020, 48 patients with COVID‐19 were all cured and
discharged.  Research conclusions The epidemiological and  clini‐
cal  characteristics of COVID‐19 patients with different genders,
clinical classification, and with or without basic  diseases  are
not very different in most cases, and slightly different in indi‐
vidual cases. Clinical manifestations and laboratory tests reveal
that  patients  with  COVID‐19 have multiple organ dysfunction or
damage.  Research perspectives The mechanism of COVID‐19  combin‐
ing  multiple  organ dysfunction or damage is worth further Lu H,
