Pet ownership
The goals of the present study were to investigate socio-demographic characteristics and well-being indicators
associated with pet ownership. The respondents (N  801, 53.8% females; 56.2% with children) came from the
ve macro-regions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18% South, 10% Central-West). Their
ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression
showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being
indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With
respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our
ndings and new research directions are discussed. Our study was conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. The
survey should be reapplied during and after the pandemic, so that we can deepen our knowledge of the sociodemographic characteristics and subjective well-being indicators associated with pet ownership.
Pets are animals maintained by humans in their households without
an apparent function (Serpell, 1989; Serpell and Paul, 2011).1 They are
named, and frequently considered members of the family. Many live
inside the home, with access to the private space of the bedroom, and
even share their owners' beds (Thompson and Smith, 2014). They have
been described as serving the function of a "living security blanket" for
children (Triebenbacher, 1998). Various theories exist to explain pet
keeping in human households:2 (i) a deep rooted tendency to seek
connection with nature, (ii) social buffering against negative effects of
stress and isolation in modern urban societies, (iii) expectancy that the
contact with animal companions promotes empathy and prosocial behaviors in children, (iv) ingrained propensity to project human mental
states onto non-human species, (v) low cost byproduct of parental
motivation explored by other species, and (vi) selectively neutral feature
maintained by genetic drift (Herzog, 2011; Serpell, 2003; Serpell and
In Brazil, dogs and cats are the most popular pets. In 2013, for the rst
the number of dogs and cats owned. The estimated canine population
was 52.2 million, and the feline population was 22.1 million, with 44.3%
of households having at least one dog, and 17.7%, at least one cat (IBGE,
2013). The National Household Sample Survey [Pesquisa Nacional por
Amostra de Domiclios  PNAD] revealed that there were 44.9 million
children aged 14 years or less, concluding that there were more pets than
children in Brazil. The Brazilian Association of the Industry of Products
for Pets [Associa~ao Brasileira da Indstria de Produtos para Animais de
Estima~ao]4 reported in 2015 that, even during the crisis faced by the
country (Barbosa Filho, 2015), the pet market obtained a turnover of R$
19.2 billion and an expansion of almost 7% compared to 2014 (Carvalho
de Ostos, 2017). In 2018, Brazilians had an average expenditure with
R. Defelipe et al.
Heliyon 6 (2020) e04069
their pets of R$ 294 per month (R$ 121 being destined dogs, and R$ 90,
to cats) (Miranda and de Otoni, 2019). Few studies to date in Brazil have
assessed pet owner's socio-demographic characteristics. These studies are
more often conducted in other countries, as can be seen in two recent
large-scale studies carried out in the US showing several
socio-demographic factors associated with pet ownership. While Saunders et al. (2017) found that more pet owners were married, females,
over 50 years old, homeowners, lived in a house, and had high household
income (Saunders et al., 2017), Applebaum et al. (2020) did not nd
signicant associations of pet ownership with gender and family income.
Besides characterizing the socio-demographic prole of pet owners,
there are several studies that have discussed some benets regarding
mental health and subjective well-being of pet ownership. Focusing on
sleep quality, while Smith et al. (2018) found that co-sleeping with dogs
apparently increased arousal and the frequency of wake ups in humans,
Hoffman et al. (2018) showed that dogs were perceived as bed partners
less disturbing than humans, promoting stronger feelings of comfort and
and help to cope with stress. Serpell (1991) also found that people who
adopted dogs or cats experienced one month later an important reduction
in minor health problems including headaches and painful joints. Some
studies have found that pet ownership is associated with lower levels of
depression (e.g., Clark Cline, 2010), while others have not found such
association (e.g., Siegel et al., 1999). In relation to social interactions,
one study pointed out that pet ownership is positively associated with
perceptions of neighborhood friendliness, favor exchanges, civic
engagement, and sense of community (Bulsara et al., 2007). Also, dog
owners showed more interest in the neighborhood (Cutt et al., 2008) and
presented higher chances to engage in a conversation with strangers
during a walk (McNicholas and Collis, 2000). Regarding conscientiousness, Allen et al. (2000) reported that pet owners expressed a sense of
responsibility for their pets, which contributed to the structure and organization of their everyday lives. Daily routines of pet maintenance
motivated physical exercise including daily walks, grooming and bathing, veterinary visits, and social events with other pet owners. In the
same line, other studies showed that people who owned dogs walked
more and were more likely to exercise regularly than non-pet owners
(Serpell, 1991; Cutt et al., 2008; Brown and Rhodes, 2006).
The disregard of sociodemographic characteristics might be one
Cline (2010) showed no main effects of pet ownership on depression, but
found interaction effects with sex and relationship status, with more
benecial effects for women and for singles. It is possible that for married
individuals to take care for a pet represents a burden, whereas for those
living alone it may reduce loneliness (Branson et al., 2017).
2.1. Participants & procedure
The sample was composed of 801 Brazilians, 431 females (53.8%)
and 370 males (46.2%). The respondents came from the ve macroregions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18%
South, and 10% Central-West). Ages ranged from 20 to 50 years (M 
34.35 years, SD  8.41) and were divided into three groups: 2029
(36.1%), 3039 (33.7%), 4050 (30.2%). Over half of the sample had

2.2.1. Socio-demographic data form
The socio-demographic data form collected information regarding
sex, age, marital status (single, cohabiting, married, divorced, widow/
er), parenthood (childless, with children), region of residence (North,
Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, South), household type (house,
apartment) and status (owner, renter), educational level (elementary
familiar income (<R$2,000; R$2,000-R$4,000; R$4,000-R$8,000;
>R$8,000; 1US Dollar  5.13 Brazilian Reais).
2.2.2. Pet ownership status
A single-item 'yes' or 'no' question was designed to ascertain pet
2.2.3. Well-being self-report measures
Respondents were asked, on a 11-point rating scale with verbal
anchors in each pole, to report their: Sleep quality (Do you sleep well? 0 I do not sleep well to 10 - I sleep extremely well); Physical tness (Are you in
good physical shape? 0 - I am in terrible physical shape to 10 - I am in great
physical shape); Sadness (Are you a sad person? 0 - Not sad at all to 10 Extremely sad); Depression (Do you feel depressed in your life? 0 - Not
depressed at all to 10 - Extremely depressed); Personal life's organization
(Are you an Organized Person? 0 - Not organized at all to 10 - Extremely
organized); Relationships with neighbors (How are your relationships with
neighbors? 0 - Not good to 10 - Extremely good); and Life satisfaction
(Thinking about your life nowadays, how satised are you? 0 - Not satised
at all to 10 - Extremely satised). Negatively-worded items (Sadness and
Depression) were reverse coded before analysis, so that high values
express better well-being, that is, lower sadness and depression. The
questionnaire used in his study is available as supplementary le (Appendix 1). These questions about well-being took part of the CPBEC
material which assessed opinions and attitudes of Brazilian population
according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Well-being.
This research was conducted by the Center for Applied Research on
rst goal was to explore differences between pet owners and non-pet
owners with respect to nine socio-demographic factors (sex, age,
household type and status, marital status, parenthood, region of residence, educational level, familiar income). The second goal was to
compare pet owners and non-pet owners with respect to seven selfreported well-being indicators (sleep quality, sadness, depression,
neighborhood relationships, level of life organization, physical tness,
and life satisfaction). Given the exploratory nature of the present study,
the analyses of association among pet ownership, socio-demographic
factors, and well-being indicators were carried out with due caution
with regard to assuming causal relationships.
2.2.4. Satisfaction with Life Scale
Respondents also evaluated their life satisfaction through the validated Brazilian version of Diener's 5-item Satisfaction with Life Scale
(SWLS). It includes items such as In most ways, my life is close to my
ideal and So far, I have gotten the important things I want in life, using
a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree
(Diener et al., 1985; Zanon et al., 2013).

were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test (Deshpande et al., 2017).
Since sex factor was associated with some of these measures, comparisons between pet and non-pet owners were performed separately by sex.
2.3. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using the software Statistical
Package for Social Sciences, version 26 (SPSS 26). In all analyses, the
signicance level adopted was 5%. Initially data screening was carried
out to check data integrity, by verifying inconsistencies, improbable
response patterns (e.g., same response to most items) and missing values
(Osborne, 2013). There were no missing data, but in total ve cases
considered outliers in their response patterns were ltered out, which
resulted in N  801. The chi-square test of independence compared the
proportion of respondents that owned or not a pet regarding to nine
categorical socio-demographic characteristics (sex, age group, region of
residence, residence type, residence status, marital status, educational
level, familiar income, and parenthood). A multivariate logistic analysis
considered pet ownership as the response and included the variables that
were signicant in the previous univariate analyses as predictors (sex,
parenthood, and residence type). All odds ratio's and respective condence intervals presented were obtained from the logistic regression. In
addition, comparisons of pet owners and non-pet owners on each of the

owning a pet for a respondent who lived in a house was 2.338 times
higher (95% CI: 1.5313.570) than for a respondent who lived in an
apartment. In addition, residence status had just a marginally signicant
effect. Residence owners had higher odds of owning pets than renters.
Family income had also just a marginally signicant effect. There were
fewer pet owners in the lowest income range (<R$2,000) in comparison
to the second income range (R$ 2,0004,000). No signicant association

3.2. Well-being self-reported measures associated with pet ownership
Signicant differences were found between males and females for
sadness (MannWhitney U test, U  64057,5, p < 0.001), and depression
(MannWhitney U test  68750, p  0.001). Males reported more
absence of Sadness (Median males  7, IQR  59; Median females  6,
IQR  48) and Depression (Median males  7, IQR  410; Median
females  6, IQR  39). Separating the sample by sex, we found an
interaction effect between pet ownership and sex. Among males (N 
370), pet owners reported better relationships with neighbors (MannWhitney U test, U  14668.5, p  0.028), better sleep quality (MannWhitney U test, U  14924.5, p  0.005) and tended to report less
sadness (MannWhitney U test, U  15165.5, p  0.088) than non-pet
regarding physical tness, depression and personal life's organization.
Among females (N  431), pet owners reported somewhat worse organization of personal life than non-pet owners (MannWhitney U test, U

Our study was conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey
can be reapplied during and after the pandemic, so that we can deepen
our knowledge of the socio-demographic characteristics and subjective
well-being indicators associated with pet ownership. Life perspectives
and motivational priorities may change in times of great challenges that
bring growing mental health concerns. The value of a pet's company may
be rethought. There may be increasing recognition of their positive
impact on human health and subjective well-being as human social
distancing increases. At the time of this publication, infectious diseases
specialists do not have evidence that companion animals can spread
COVID-19 to other animals or to people (AVMA, 2020).
Five socio-demographic variables (residence type and status, family
income, sex, and parenthood) distinguished pet owners from non-pet
owners. Respondents who resided in houses were more likely to be pet
owners than those who lived in apartments, probably due to space
availability. This was found in other studies, in Brazil (Serani et al.,
2008), and also in Ireland (Hepper and Wells, 1997; Downes et al., 2011).
In addition, in our study renters tended to report less pet ownership
compared to homeowners. There are rental agreements that contain
no-pet clauses. Although there is no law that specically addresses the
issue of pets, the homeowner has the right to deny rent to anyone for
whatever reasons he/she wishes because the residence is his/her property. The same happens in US where, according to O'Reilly-Jones (2019),
homeowner-imposed restrictions disproportionately impact low-income
Although the sex difference regarding pet ownership was relatively
small, we found that females had higher chances to be pet owners than
males. In surveys conducted in 11 Eurasian countries (Phillips et al.,
2011) and in US (Dotson and Hyatt, 2008), females were the pets' primary caregivers. This may have also happened in our study, but, to know
for sure, this question should be examined more directly in future studies.
In our study, childless respondents were more likely to own a pet
compared to those who had children. This result is in line with the idea
that pets can serve as substitutes for friends, spouses or children, especially in today's society where people feel socially isolated and have
fewer children (Chur-Hansen, 2010; Antonacopoulos and Pychyl, 2010).
In summary, in the current study, pet owners tended to live in houses, to
be homeowners, females, and childless.
We further investigated the relationship of pet ownership and sex
with well-being self-reported measures. This analysis showed that females, regardless of pet ownership status, reported somewhat more
depression and sadness than males. These results are consistent with
ndings from other studies that have shown that females experience
more negative emotions (Else-Quest et al., 2012), and are more vulnerable to develop general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress, and
depression than males (Kessler, 2003; Victor et al., 2017). In our study,
we found interaction between pet ownership and sex. However, contrary
to our expectation (see Clark Cline, 2010), we found that pet ownership
was associated with better sleep quality, better relationships with
neighbors and less sadness among men, and lower life organization
among women. Other studies showed that pet owners, regardless of sex,
fell asleep more easily than non-pet owners (Coleman et al., 2008; Mein
& Grant, 2018). Pets may provide humans with opportunities of: (a)
social interaction and closeness (being represented here by better relationships with neighbors), and (b) worth reassurance and feelings of
protection (being represented here by less sadness) (e.g., Staats et al.,
2008). These opportunities may also mediate the better quality of sleep
associated with animal companionship. Some pet owners may share their
beds with dogs, and this may promote good sleep via increased feelings of
comfort and security. Future studies could investigate the association
with the place where pets sleep in the house among pet owners. Finally,
we highlight that the lower level of life organization reported by female
pet owners was an unexpected result. Allen, Kellegrew, and Jaffe (2000)
found that pet owners structured more their everyday lives, becoming
more and not less organized. However, we could consider that non-pet
owners may prioritize a neat and clean home, whereas pet owners may
prioritize mitigation of social isolation (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975).
Although pet ownership can bring more structure to daily routines, when
life is too busy, having a pet can represent a burden for the pet's primary
caregiver, disorganizing daily routines. This is a hypothesis that should
be investigated in future studies. In the present study, pet owners did not
differ in life satisfaction from non-pet owners, neither considering the
single-item life satisfaction measure used nor Diener's 5-item Satisfaction
with Life Scale (SWLS). This result is different from Applebaum's et al.
were more satised with their lives than non-pet owners (Bao & Schreer,
4.1. Limitations and future research
One limitation of our study is that the survey offered only one question about pet ownership, with a yes or no answer choice that did not
allow respondents to tell what type of pet they owned. Moreover, to
establish causal associations on pet ownership and mental health, it
would be necessary to implement a longitudinal study comparing
repeated well-being self-reports from pet owners and non-pet owners,
controlling both groups by sociodemographic characteristics, to identify
what kind of mental health improvement could be attributed, in fact, to
pet ownership.
