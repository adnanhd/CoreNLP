tal  admissions  and  mortality from the Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID‐19) pandemic are spreading throughout the world, and  sec‐
ond  and  third waves are thought to be likely.  Risk factors for
severe COVID‐19 include diabetes, chronic kidney disease and car‐
diovascular  disease.  Currently,  there is no vaccine and no ap‐
proved therapy. Therapeutic approaches are  aimed  at  preventing
viral  replication and spread, limiting the impact of the inflam‐
matory overdrive (cytokine storm), preventing thromboembolic com‐
plications  and  replacing or supporting organ function. However,
despite organ support, mortality is currently 65% for  those  re‐
ceiving  advanced respiratory support and 78% for those requiring
renal replacement therapies. Thus, efforts should be made to pro‐
vide  adjuvant  organ  protection  therapy.  This may imply novel
therapies in clinical development  (e.g.,  the  Fas  ligand  trap
asunercept),  but  uptake of repurposed drugs already in clinical
use may be faster.  In  this  regard,  sodium  glucose  co‐trans‐
porter‐2  (SGLT2)  inhibitors  were recently shown to protect the
heart and kidney both within and outside  of  a  diabetic  milieu
context.   Further,  preclinical data support a beneficial effect
for the lung. We now discuss the potential benefits and risks  of
SGLT2  inhibitors in COVID‐19 and an ongoing clinical trial test‐
ing the impact of dapagliflozin on outcomes in COVID‐19  patients
with  respiratory failure.  Keywords: COVID‐19; diabetes; chronic
kidney  disease;  cardiovascular;   SGLT2;   canagliflozin;   da‐
pagliflozin; empagliflozin Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is
a pandemic  caused  by  the  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome
(SARS)‐Coronavirus  (CoV)‐2. This is the third recent outbreak of
coronaviruses following the SARS‐CoV (2002) and the  Middle  East
respiratory  syndrome  (MERS)‐CoV  (2015). It originated J. Clin.
Med. 2020, 9, 2030 from the Chinese city  of  Wuhan  in  December
2019  and as of 8 June 2020 has infected more than 7 million peo‐
ple worldwide with more than 400,000  deaths  [13].  Most  common
presenting  symptoms  include  fatigue, fever, cough, dyspnea and
diarrhea while median time between symptoms onset and death is 14
days [46]. The mortality rate of 2.8% (median age of 75 years) is
lower than the 10% mortality in SARS‐CoV  and  37%  mortality  in
MERS‐CoV;  however,  higher  absolute numbers of cases and deaths
are  explained  by  easy  transmission  via  direct  contact   or
droplets, as well as transmission by asymptomatic or mildly symp‐
tomatic individuals [4,79]. Although the search of reservoir ani‐
mals has been inconclusive so far, there is 88% genetic similari‐
ty between SARS‐CoV‐2 and two bat‐derived  coronaviruses  [1012].
Possible  fecal‐oral  transmission  has  also been reported while
vaginal virus delivery has not been proven [1315].  The estimated
mortality of diagnosed cases ranges from 2.3% to 15.2%, depending
on patient populations, diagnostic strategies and, probably,  ad‐
ditional  poorly  characterized factors [16,17]. The need for in‐
tensive care unit (ICU) admission is around 20%  [18].  In  ICUs,
about 90% require respiratory support via either mechanical (88%)
or non‐invasive ventilation (12%) and mortality hovers around 50%
[19].  Older age, higher sequential organ failure assessment (SO‐
FA) score, D‐dimer >1 g/mL, presence of comorbid diseases or sec‐
ondary  infections,  elevated  inflammatory markers, low CD3+ and
CD8+ T cell counts and cardiac troponin >0.05 ng/mL predict  mor‐
tality  while acute respiratory failure and fulminant myocarditis
are the most commonly reported causes of death [20 organ  protec‐
tion  and  the  potential  beneficial  role of sodium glucose co‐
transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in  the  COVID‐19  context.   2.
Risk  Factors  for Severe COVID‐19 Clinical conditions associated
with a higher risk for severe complications and death in  COVID19
infected  patients  include  cardiovascular disease, diabetes and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). A  recent  meta‐analysis  including
1527 patients from six different studies, mostly from Wuhan (Chi‐
na), showed that  hypertension  (17.1%),  cardiovascular  disease
(16.4%), and diabetes (9.7%) were the most prevalent diseases ob‐
served in patients with severe COVID‐19 complications  [23].  The
fatality rate was 10.5, 7.3 and 6% in persons with cardiovascular
disease, diabetes and  hypertension,  respectively,  whereas  the
overall  fatality rate was 2.3% in the COVID‐19 summary report of
72,314 cases released by the Chinese Center for  Disease  Control
[24]. Thus, patients with previous cardiovascular disease and di‐
abetes had more severe disease and more complications [25].  Car‐
diovascular  disease  and  diabetes are closely linked to CKD. In
this regard, a meta‐analysis of four studies, which included 1389
COVID‐19  patients,  disclosed that CKD was associated with a se‐
vere presentation of the disease (OR, 3.03; 95%CI, 1.098.47), de‐
spite  none  of  the  individual studies showing this association
[26]. The likely explanation may be the higher number of patients
analyzed  in  the meta‐analysis. COVID‐19 may also be complicated
by acute kidney injury (AKI), which  developed  in  5.1%  of  701
adults  in  a prospective cohort study [27]. Mortality was higher
in patients with elevated than normal serum creatinine  at  base‐
line: HR, 2.10; 95%CI, 1.363.26. Additionally, although not prom‐
inent in early Wuhan reports, renal disease was the  most  common
comorbidity among the first 6720 reported critically ill COVID‐19
patients in the UK, being five‐fold more common than cardiovascu‐
lar  disease  3. Current Therapeutic Approaches to COVID‐19 There
is no specific treatment for SARS‐CoV‐2. Several  studies  aiming
to  identify  novel therapeutic agents and vaccines against SARS‐
CoV‐2 are ongoing, but their safety and efficacy need to  be  as‐
sessed  before generalized use [2931]. In this emergency context,
the health community has initially promoted the off‐label use  of
approved drugs to try to control the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection as well
as to manage the inflammatory, thrombotic, respiratory  and  car‐
diovascular  complications  in  J. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 2030 SGLT2
inhibitors.  3.1. Antiviral Therapies The primary goal during the
initial  phases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is to stop the virus cell
cycle and slow down disease progression. The SARS‐CoV‐2 cell  cy‐
cle  resembles  that  of  other coronaviruses (i.e., SARS‐CoV and
MERS‐CoV) and shares replication mechanisms with other RNA virus‐
es (i.e., HIV or Ebola). Therefore, approved drugs to treat other
viral infections or with a potential to interfere in viral propa‐
gation   mechanism   have   been   tested  in  COVID‐19  patients
[29,30,32,33]. Coronaviruses target host cells via direct  inter‐
action  of  the viral spike (S) protein with a cell membrane pro‐
tein. In particular, SARS‐CoV‐2, like SARS‐CoV, enters host cells
via  the  angiotensin  converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an endocytosis
process facilitated by the type 2 transmembrane  serine  protease
(TMPRSS2)  [34,35]. A recent preprint report described SARS‐CoV‐2
entry into host cells by interacting with basigin, also known  as
extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) or clus‐
ter of differentiation  147  (CD147)  [34].  Once  inside  cells,
viruses  promote  the  translation of their nonessential polypro‐
teins that after proteolysis will form  a  replication‐transcrip‐
tion  complex  to  replicate J. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 2030 targets.
This picture shows a simplified SARS‐CoV‐2 life cycle in the tar‐
get  cells  as  well  as  a representation of the immune response
against the virus. The targets of  antiviral  therapies  and  im‐
munomodulation  approaches  are highlighted.  The virus‐host cell
recognition may be prevented by soluble  recombinant  human  ACE2
(rhACE2)  or  convalescent SARS‐CoV‐2 sera [36,37]. The potential
therapeutic role of rhACE2 for COVID‐19 is under study as it  de‐
creased  SARS‐CoV‐2 infectivity in human engineered blood vessels
and kidney organoids [38,39]. Blocking CD147‐mediated virus entry
could  also be a therapeutic option [40]. Meplazumab, a humanized
antibody against CD147, was reported to accelerate COVID19  reso‐
lution  in  seventeen  COVID‐19 patients [41]. In addition, viral
endocytosis can be inhibited  by  drugs.  Camostat  mesylate  and
nafamostat  mesylate  are  serine protease inhibitors that target
TMPRSS2 and  block  SARS‐CoV‐2  infection  in  human  lung  cells
[35,42].  Camostat mesylate is approved in Japan to treat pancre‐
atitis and COVID‐19 clinical trials are ongoing [43]. Chloroquine
and its hydroxylated form (hydroxychloroquine) were discovered in
the early 30s and 50s, respectively. Both drugs  are  weak  bases
that  accumulate in acidic compartments such as lysosomes and au‐
tosomes, interfering with normal endocytosis  processes.  Chloro‐
quine was initially developed to treat malaria and hydroxychloro‐
quine to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but they are now approved to
treat  diseases  ranging from cancer to chronic inflammatory dis‐
eases [44]. Because of a known safety profile and low cost,  they
are  being tested for both COVID‐19 prevention and treatment with
encouraging results although their efficacy has  been  questioned
[33,45,46].  Arbidol  (umifenovir)  is a broad‐spectrum antiviral
drug that blocks the virus‐cell membrane fusion by  intercalating
into  membrane  lipids [47,48]. Its use is approved for influenza
treatment in Russia and China, and it is being tested in clinical
trials  for  COVID‐19.  Wuhan  data report better outcomes in pa‐
tients treated with arbidol alone or in  combination  with  other
antiretroviral drugs [49,50]. Drugs that block viral RNA replica‐
tion include lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir, which inhibit the
viral  3‐chymotrypsinlike protease and are second line antiretro‐
virals for HIV [51]. However, the first randomized clinical trial
(RCT)  testing  Lopinavir/Ritonavir  suggested a limited efficacy
for  SARS‐CoV‐2  infections  [52].   Ribavirin,  remdesivir   and
favipiravir  are  broad‐range  viral RNA polymerase blockers that
have been previously tested for Hepatitis C, Ebola or  Influenza,
among others [5357]. Their efficacy in COVID19 is currently being
tested in several RCTs following the publication of case  reports
of  successful  remdesivir  or  favipiravir use [5860].  J. Clin.
Med. 2020, 9, 2030 3.2. Anti‐Inflammatory Therapies In later dis‐
ease  stages,  immunomodulation  strategies should be considered.
Viral infections are proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may
lead  to  a  cytokine  storm, thought to be the main cause of the
SARS‐CoV‐2 acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is  associ‐
ated  to thromboembolic events leading to multi‐organ failure and
death [61,62]. Although immunomodulation therapies remain contro‐
versial  in  the COVID‐19 context because they may negatively in‐
fluence the natural immune response against the virus [63],  sev‐
eral  ongoing  RCTs  aim to minimize immune system overactivation
[30]. The main immunomodulatory strategies are [29] enhancing in‐
nate  immune responses by administering recombinant interferon or
natural‐killer cells and [30] decrease inflammatory responses via
the  use  of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, intra‐
venous  administration  of  general  or  SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific  im‐
munoglobulins,  infusion  of mesenchymal stem cells, and blocking
interleukin‐1 (anakinra), interleukin‐6 (tocilizumab,  sarilumab)
or  complement activation (eculizumab and 5 additional agents are
in clinical trials) [30,64]. Finally, it has been suggested  that
extracorporeal treatment, for example high‐volume hemofiltration,
may play a role in patients with  COVID  19  and  cytokine  storm
[65].   3.3.  Anti‐Thrombotic  Strategies Classical anticoagulant
therapies were initially applied to COVID‐19 patients at risk  of
thrombotic   and   thromboembolic  events  [66].  However,  since
COVID‐19 patients with acute respiratory failure  present  severe
hypercoagulability  with fibrin formation and polymerization that
may predispose to thrombosis and correlates with  worse  outcome,
the  use of low molecular weight heparin was extended to patients
not requiring admission, especially if there is a  high  risk  of
venous  thromboembolism  (e.g.,  reduced  mobility or co‐morbidi‐
ties), elevated D‐dimer (>2 times the upper limit normal) and low
risk  of bleeding [67].  3.4. Organ Support, Replacement and Pro‐
tection In some cases, organ failure needs organ  replacement  or
support  therapies.  The most common are respiratory support (ad‐
vanced respiratory support was required by 70% of  UK  critically
ill  patients),  renal  replacement therapies (required in 22% of
these patients) and cardiovascular support  [68].  Mortality  was
65%  for those receiving advanced respiratory support and 78% for
those requiring renal replacement therapies. The  high  mortality
of patients requiring organ support points to the need to develop
and  implement  organ  protective  strategies.  As  an   example,
Apogenix  is  to start clinical trials of asunercept (APG101) for
COVID‐19. This is, a human fusion protein consisting of  the  ex‐
tracellular domain of the CD95 (Fas, TNFRSF6) receptor and the Fc
domain of an IgG antibody that  prevents  Fas‐induced  epithelial
cell  death.  Fas  is upregulated in kidney cells during systemic
inflammation and promotes lung and  kidney  cell  death  [69,70].
However,  despite  potential  to  protect  both  lung and kidney,
asunercept is still in early stages of clinical development [71].
Drug  repurposing  offers the possibility of accelerated clinical
translation. In this regard, SGLT2 inhibitors were recently shown
to  have heart and kidney organ protective properties both within
and outside of a diabetic milieu context [7274] and  could  offer
an  opportunity  for organ protection in COVID19.  3.5. SGLT2 In‐
hibitors: From Glucose Lowering to  Organ  Protection  SGLT2  in‐
hibitors  are  oral  hypoglycemic agents for patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (2DM)  [75].  One  member  of  the  class,  da‐
pagliflozin,  was  also  recently approved in Europe for patients
with T1DM. They block SGLT2, a high‐capacity/low‐affinity glucose
transporter  located  in the S1 segment of renal proximal tubules
and responsible for 90% of glucose reabsorption [76]. In diabetic
patients,  SGLT2 expression increases up to 3‐fold. However, this
effort to preserve glucose by preventing urinary  excretion  fur‐
ther  deranges  glucose  homeostasis. SGLT2 inhibition results in
excretion of 50‐ J. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 2030 60% of filtered glu‐
cose,  roughly corresponding to 60100 g/day and loss of the asso‐
ciated calories SGLT2 inhibitors have  beneficial  metabolic  and
cardiovascular  effects.  Loss  of  glucose  in  urine results in
weight loss of around 24 kg within 36 months [78].  Further,  the
double  mild natriuretic action (SGLT2 inhibition and the osmotic
effect of glucosuria) causes clinically meaningful blood pressure
reductions of 45/23 mmHg [79]. SGLT2 inhibition decrease of sodi‐
um reabsorption results in decreased energy expenditure by proxi‐
mal  tubular  cells,  potentially  influencing other functions of
these metabolically active cells. SGLT2 inhibitors are  generally
well‐tolerated,  with the most frequent adverse event being geni‐
tal mycotic infections and the most serious the rare  development
of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [80].  Accumulating ev‐
idence suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors are potent  cardioprotective
and  nephroprotective agents [81]. The Empagliflozin Cardiovascu‐
lar Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EM‐
PA‐REG OUTCOME), which randomized 7020 patients with T2DM and es‐
tablished cardiovascular disease  to  empagliflozin  or  placebo,
first  showed reductions of 14% in the primary outcome (non‐fatal
myocardial infarction or stroke,  or  death  from  cardiovascular
causes)  (HR,  0.86;  95%CI, 0.740.99; p = 0.04 for superiority),
38% in cardiovascular death, 35%  in  hospitalization  for  heart
failure   (HHF)   and   32%  in  all‐cause  mortality  [82].  The
CanagliflozinCardiovascular‐Assessment‐Study (CANVAS)  randomized
10,142  T2DM patients with either established cardiovascular dis‐
ease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors to canagliflozin  or
placebo and also showed 14% reduction in the same primary outcome
(HR, 0.86; 95%CI, 0.750.97); p = 0.02 for superiority),  33%  re‐
duction  in  HHF  and  a non‐significant trend towards lower all‐
cause mortality (HR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.741.01) [83]. The Multicenter
Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on the Incidence of
Cardiovascular Events Thrombolysis in  Myocardial  Infarction  58
(DECLARE‐TIMI  58) trial included 17,160 patients (10,186 without
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, i.e., a lower‐risk  popu‐
lation) and showed non‐inferiority of dapagliflozin in the afore‐
mentioned primary composite outcome and superiority  compared  to
placebo with regards to HHF (HR, 0.73; 95%CI, 0.610.88) [84]. Fi‐
nally, the recent DAPAgliflozin in Heart Failure  (DAPAHF)  study
included  4744  patients  (with  or without T2DM) with NYHA II‐IV
heart failure and an ejection fraction <40% (heart  failure  with
reduced ejection fraction) and showed that dapagliflozin signifi‐
cantly reduced the primary outcome of worsening heart failure  or
cardiovascular death (HR, 0.74; 95%CI, 0.650.85) in both diabetic
and non‐diabetic patients [73,85].  In parallel, preliminary evi‐
dence  suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce albu‐
minuria in comparison  to  placebo  or  active  antihyperglycemic
agents [86], while all the cardiovascular safety trials (EMPA‐REG
OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE‐TIMI) showed prominent effects  on  out‐
comes associated with kidney disease progression [83,84,87]. In a
metaanalysis of these trials, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the  inci‐
dence  of the composite renal outcome of worsening renal function
(doubling of serum  creatinine  accompanied  by  an  eGFR  of  45
mL/min/1.73  m2),  end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) defined as eGFR
<15 mL/min/1.73 m2) or renal death (defined as:  any  adjudicated
non‐CV  death  event  where the adjudication committee assigned a
renal proximate cause is considered a renal death)  by  45%  (HR,
0.55;  95%CI,  0.480.64)  [88]. The recent CREDENCE study in 4401
patients with T2DM and diabetic kidney disease (CKD and  albumin‐
to‐creatinine‐ratio  3005000 mg/g) was prematurely stopped, show‐
ing reductions of 34% in the composite of ESRD, doubling of serum
creatinine,  or  renal  death  and 32% in ESRD with canagliflozin
compared to placebo [87]. Recently, the Study to Evaluate the Ef‐
fect  of  Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mor‐
tality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA‐CKD), a  re‐
nal  outcome  trial evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin in pa‐
tients with diabetic or non‐diabetic  CKD  was  also  prematurely
stopped  due to benefit [89].  The use of eGFR as an endpoint has
been criticized since there is evidence  that  SGLT2  may  reduce
muscle  mass  and this may be associated with lower serum creati‐
nine values [90]. However, this criticism does not apply to short
term  studies in which GFR was measured [91], as well as to albu‐
minuria or hard (death) renal endpoints.  J. Clin. Med. 2020,  9,
2030  Several  hypotheses  on  the mechanisms contributing to the
cardioprotective properties of SGLT2 inhibitors  were  generated,
including  reductions in glycemia, body weight, visceral adiposi‐
ty, uric acid, albuminuria, sympathetic tone, a shift  from  glu‐
cose  to  fatty  acid  oxidation resulting in increased levels of
‐hydroxybutyrate which is a better cardiac fuel or a  direct  ef‐
fect  of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiomyocytes [92,93]. However, the
dissociation of the curves for the outcomes  that  displayed  the
larger  differences  between groups in these trials (HHF and car‐
diovascular death) were observed during the first weeks  suggest‐
ing  that  hemodynamic mechanisms, including mild natriuresis and
reductions in blood pressure, may  play  a  more  prominent  role
[81].  Similarly,  anti‐inflammatory and antifibrotic effects and
reversal of renal hypoxia of these agents could  help  towards  a
renoprotective action [9496], but modulation of renal microcircu‐
lation  is  the  most  possible  renoprotective  mechanism  [81].
Briefly,  DM promotes renal injury through afferent arteriole va‐
sodilation resulting in increased  intraglomerular  pressure  and
albuminuria.  SGLT2 inhibitors through inhibition of sodium reab‐
sorption in proximal tubules increase  its  distal  availability;
this  is  sensed  by  the  macula densa, which restores the tubu‐
loglomerular feedback resulting in reversal of  the  vasodilation
of the afferent arteriole, decreased intraglomerular pressure and
proteinuria [81,97]. However, additional potential mechanisms  of
action  remain  underexplored.  Thus,  ‐hydroxybutyrate modulates
epigenetic regulation of gene expression by promoting histone Ly‐
sine  ‐hydroxybutyrylation,  a histone mark that promotes the ex‐
pression of cell protective genes such as Ppargc1a (which encodes
PGC‐1)  [9799].   Based  on the above findings, several consensus
reports from  major  international  bodies  recommend  SGLT2  in‐
hibitors  as  the drug of choice after metformin in patients with
T2DM and evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,  CKD
or  heart failure [81,100]. Additionally, clinical guidelines are
starting to recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for  patients  with  heart
failure  with  reduced ejection fraction with or without diabetes
[101,102].  More recently, preclinical studies, although  limited
to the vasculature, suggest a potential role for SGLT2 inhibitors
in lung protection. Thus, in ex vivo studies,  canagliflozin  re‐
laxed  mouse pulmonary arteries in a dose‐dependent manner [103].
In rat pulmonary arterial  hypertension,  empagliflozin  improved
survival,  reduced medial wall thickening and decreased muscular‐
ization of pulmonary arterioles  [104].  However,  the  molecular
mechanisms  of this protective effect remain unclear, despite the
observation that  empagliflozin  was  associated  with  increased
apoptosis  and  decreased  proliferation in pulmonary vessels and
thus prevented adverse pulmonary arteriole Overall, there is  ac‐
cumulating  clinical  and  preclinical data suggesting that SGLT2
inhibitors have the potential to provide  organ  protection  both
inside and outside of the diabetic context.  4. Current Recommen‐
dations and Potential Dangers of SGLT2  Inhibitors  During  Acute
Illness  During  acute  illness, care should be taken with volume
depletion, blood pressure  reduction  and  DKA  when  prescribing
SGLT2  inhibitors. In the context of COVID‐19, there is addition‐
ally the potential for interaction with other drugs. In this  re‐
gard,  health  agencies  (Royal United Hospitals, NHS Foundation,
Catalan Health agency, among others)  have  warned  about  safety
concerns for SLGT2i and the risk of DKA in patients with both di‐
abetes and COVID19 infection. In this setting, they  have  recom‐
mended  to  avoid SGLT2 inhibitors in all patients with risk fac‐
tors  for  developing  symptoms  or  serious   complications   of
COVID‐19,  such as patients with a history of hypertension, T2DM,
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and/or  es‐
timated GFR <25 mL/min/1.73 m2. In this regard, COVID‐19 patients
may decrease food intake and may develop diarrhea  and  study  to
support  this  recommendation.  It would probably be necessary to
individualize the recommendation to discontinue SGLT2  inhibitors
only in COVID‐19 infected patients who present symptoms that pre‐
dispose to a decrease in blood pressure or  vascular  volume,  to
avoid  both the deterioration of renal function or DKA.  J. Clin.
Med. 2020, 9, 2030 4.1. Volume  Depletion  SGLT2  inhibitors  may
cause  volume  depletion  leading to acute kidney injury, usually
within well‐defined circumstances  such  as  concomitant  use  of
high‐dose  loop diuretics, low baseline blood pressure, treatment
with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs or concomitant  diges‐
tive  problems  impairment [86]. Moreover, the glomerular hemody‐
namic effects of combining renin‐angiotensin system (RAS)  block‐
ade  and  SGLT2  inhibitors  usually  cause  a  mild  decrease in
glomerular filtration rate, which is  associated  with  long‐term
preservation  in renal function [105]. Nevertheless, metaanalyses
comparing Canagliflozin or Dapagliflozin with either  placebo  or
active  comparator  and  one comparing Empagliflozin with placebo
did not confirm a significant volume  depletion  with  SGLT2  in‐
hibitors [106]. In any case, hospitalized patients with mild‐mod‐
erate manifestations of COVID‐19 should be monitored  to  prevent
volume depletion and renal impairment.  4.2. Blood Pressure SGLT2
inhibitors tend to decrease blood pressure due to  their  osmotic
diuretic effect, thus potentially causing orthostatic hypotension
and dizziness, especially when  combined  with  diuretics  [107].
Other  diuresis‐independent actions leading to blood pressure re‐
duction, including effects on ion transporters, sympathetic  ner‐
vous  system activity, and vascular function, have also been pro‐
posed, although clinical evidence  supporting  these  is  sparse.
Regulators  warn  of the risk of DKA, especially in T1DM patients
receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, 5% to 12% of whom develop DKA  [107].
An  increased risk of DKA was also recorded in T2DM RCTs of SGLT2
inhibitors [108,109].  In  44,000  patient‐years,  DKA  incidence
rates  were 0.160.76 events per 1000 patient‐years for an overall
incidence of <0.1% of all treated patients [107], and in all cas‐
es,  a  precipitating  factor  was  present. The risk factors for
SGLT2 inhibitors‐associated DKA are those conditions  leading  to
restricted food intake or severe dehydration, alcohol abuse, sud‐
den reduction in insulin or increased insulin requirements due to
acute  illness  such  as low beta cell function reserve (patients
with T2DM who have low C‐peptide levels, latent  autoimmune  dia‐
betes  in adults (LADA) or a history of pancreatitis) [108]. Sick
day rules to manage diabetes during intercurrent illness help  to
prevent future complications [110]. In this regard, patients pre‐
senting COVID‐19 symptoms may decrease food intake,  blood  pres‐
sure  or vascular volume. SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued
immediately if DKA is suspected or diagnosed since  DKA  requires
urgent  hospital  admission.   Physicians  and patients should be
aware of early symptoms associated to DKA (thirst,  polyuria  and
sweet,  fruity  breath,  abdominal pain and vomiting) in order to
stop them timely.  4.4. Interactions with  Experimental  COVID‐19
Drugs  Most interactions of experimental drugs currently used for
COVID‐19 are related to the potential increased or decreased  ex‐
posures to or toxicities from co‐medication therapies or COVID‐19
drugs.  In this regard, both hydroxychloroquine and  azithromycin
prolong  the QT interval, and their association may trigger fatal
torsade de pointes arrhythmia [111]. The currently known drug ex‐
pected interactions for empagliflozin or dapagliflozin were list‐
ed, while canagliflozin may potentially interact with  lopinavir‐
ritonavir (Kaletra) requiring monitoring and eventual drug dosing
5. Clinical Trials of SGLT2 Inhibitors  in  COVID‐19  Summarizing
the  current situation for COVID‐19, there is no therapy approved
for COVID‐19, and current experimental  therapies  are  aimed  at
preventing  viral  replication and spread, limiting the impact of
the inflammatory overdrive (cytokine  storm),  preventing  throm‐
boembolic  complications  and replacing or supporting organ func‐
tion. However, mortality in patients requiring organ support  ex‐
ceeds 60%. Thus, efforts should be made to provide adjuvant organ
protection therapies. Despite J. Clin. Med. 2020, 9, 2030  a  po‐
tential  higher  risk for SGLT2 inhibitors adverse effects in the
context of acute illness and the resulting current advise against
using  them  in  COVID‐19 patients, as recently emphasized [112],
they have a favorable efficacy profile in preserving renal  func‐
tion,  decreasing  the impact of heart failure and increasing the
survival of patients with risk factors for  severe  COVID‐19.  In
preclinical studies, SGLT2 inhibitors had lung protective effects
by decreasing oxidative stress, tissue hypoxia  and  inflammation
[81,113115]. Such an uncertainty regarding the use and risk‐bene‐
fit balance of commonly prescribed drugs is not new in the histo‐
ry of treatment for severe disease or in the COVID19 context. Be‐
ta blockers were contraindicated for many years in patients  with
heart  failure,  until  RCTs  showed benefit. Regarding COVID‐19,
many physicians rushed to stop RAS blockade in patients with sus‐
pected  COVID‐19  (personal  observation)  following a hypothesis
that these drugs might be detrimental for COVID‐19 as  in  animal
models  they increase ACE2 (the receptor of SARSCoV‐2) expression
in cardiac [116] and vascular tissue [117]. The influence of  RAS
blockers  on lung ACE2 expression is unknown both in experimental
models and in humans. On the other hand, the  protective  effects
of ACE2 have been widely described. Thus, an increased expression
of ACE2 may be protective rather than detrimental in the COVID‐19
context  and  rhACE2  is being pursued as a potential therapy for
COVID‐19 [118,119]. Clear statements by multiple scientific soci‐
eties  tried to dispel these doubts, supporting continuous use of
RAS blockade,  unless  an  established  contraindication  is  met
[120122].   Given the uncertain risk‐benefit balance of SGLT2 in‐
hibitors, a clinical trial would be needed to address the  issue.
In this regard, from 15 April 2020, an ongoing RCT (Dapagliflozin
in  Respiratory  Failure  in  Patients  with  COVID‐19,  DARE‐19,
NCT04350593)  is  testing dapagliflozin in patients with COVID‐19
and respiratory failure to assess impact on disease  progression,
complications and allcause mortality. In this international, mul‐
ticenter, phase 3 double blind RCT, patients will initiate treat‐
ment  with dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, once a day for 30 days
on top of the standard local protocol for COVID19 treatment.  The
trial  will  randomize  900  hospitalized  COVID‐19 patients with
mild‐moderate disease severity, not needing mechanical ventilator
support  at the time of screening and having a prior cardiovascu‐
lar or renal condition that impairs outcomes. Inclusion  criteria
comprise confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with chest radiography or
CT scan compatible with COVID‐19, mild‐moderate disease (SpO2 94%
with  3  L supplemental oxygen) and at least one of the following
conditions: hypertension,  T2DM,  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular
disease,  heart  failure  and/or  CKD  stage  3  to  4 (eGFR 2560
mL/min/1.73 m2). Key exclusion criteria include  short  life  ex‐
pectancy  (<24 h), SBP <95 mm Hg and/or needing inotropic medica‐
tion or mechanical circulatory support at screening, T1DM, treat‐
ment  in the last 14 days or under treatment with antiimmunologi‐
cal drugs for COVID‐19, DKA history in  the  prior  6  months  or
treatment  with  any  SGLT2 inhibitors at screening or within the
prior 4 weeks. The primary endpoint will be time to first  occur‐
rence  of  all‐cause  mortality or new/worsened organ dysfunction
through 30 days of follow up.  Organ dysfunction may  consist  of
respiratory  decompensation, heart failure, cardiovascular insta‐
bility, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation or need for  drug
or  mechanical  circulatory support or renal replacement therapy.
A second trial will assess the efficacy of the novel  immunomodu‐
latory  agent  EDP1815  (a  strain of Prevotella histicola) and a
combination of the approved  cardiovascular  drugs  dapagliflozin
and  ambrisentan  as  potential  treatments  for COVID‐19 disease
against Standard of Care alone A recent report of  the  off‐label
prescription  of empagliflozin 10 mg for 57 days in three nondia‐
betic hospitalized patients with  severe  bilateral  interstitial
COVID‐19‐related pneumonia concluded that no favorable action re‐
lated to treatment was obtained [123]. However, it is unclear how
this  conclusion  may  be reached in the absence of controls. The
three patients apparently survived, which should be considered  a
good  outcome for a potentially lethal disease.  SGLT2 inhibitors
have shown unexpected clinical benefit regarding heart and kidney
protection  both within and outside the context of T2DM, suggest‐
ing potential intrinsic organ protective effects.  J. Clin.  Med.
2020,  9, 2030 This is supported by preclinical data that suggest
a range of potential mechanisms of action, not limited to hemody‐
namic  effects. These mechanisms of action may impact cell resis‐
tance to diverse stressors by decreasing oxidative stress and in‐
flammation.  Thus,  SGLT2 inhibitors may be potentially SGLT2 in‐
hibitors in acutely ill patients, any use  of  these  agents  for
COVID‐19 patients with severe disease should be in the context of
a clinical trial. Fortunately, results of the ongoing DARE‐19 da‐
pagliflozin   in  respiratory  failure  trial  in  patients  with
COVID‐19 are expected by December 2020, thus potentially on  time
for  second or third waves of COVID‐19. Additionally, the results
of this trial may guide the field of SGLT2  inhibitors  in  organ
protection  beyond  viral  infection or diabetes.  Current Status
