publications. Results: the spectrum of clinical disease was wide; fever, coughing and dyspnea were the most frequent signs/
symptoms, however, they may not be present, thus hindering case definition; gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of taste or
smell have been reported among mild cases; dyspnea was frequent among severe and fatal cases. Conclusion: considering
the scarcity of diagnostic tests and the diversity of symptoms, health services should use a sensitive case definition, in order
to adopt appropriate surveillance, prevention and treatment actions.

Suspected COVID-19 case definition
The coronavirus 2 pandemic related to severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged at the end
of 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has spread
rapidly across all continents, exponentially increasing
the number of infected people and causing thousands
of deaths worldwide.1 It is estimated that as at April 26th
2020, more than 2.8 million people had been infected
and over 193,000 had died from causes related to the
disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).2
Given its vast magnitude and the diverse supplies
needed to control it, such as availability of diagnostic tests
for affected people, combating COVID-19 has become
a challenge, especially for low and middle-income
countries such as Brazil which depend on technologies
produced in other countries.3
Assessing clinical signs and symptoms
shown by infected people can
help establish the healthcare flow
and indicate the need to perform
confirmatory tests.
How can SARS-CoV-2 infection be diagnosed or defined,
if health centers do not have sufficient laboratory tests
available? Moreover, diagnostic tests are intended to be
used at specific times of infection and, depending on
the stage of the disease, may not be very accurate.4,5 As
such, assessing clinical signs and symptoms shown by
infected people can help establish the healthcare flow
and indicate the need to perform confirmatory tests.6
The objective of this study was to describe the most
frequent signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
in order to guide case suspicion based on clinical
manifestations and to characterize case severity.

of SARS-CoV-2 infection? The bibliographic search was
performed on the Scopus, medRXiv, MEDLINE, SciELO
and Google Scholar databases, and it was complemented
with a manual search on the lists of references of the

fever, tiredness, coughing, mild dyspnea, anorexia, sore
throat, aching body, headache or blocked nose, some
may also have diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Signs
and symptoms in elderly and immunocompromised
people may be atypical and worsen rapidly, which can
cause death, especially in the case of the elderly and
people with pre-existing comorbidities.
The case definitions adopted by the Brazilian Health
Ministry were established in February10 and March
were initially based on the occurrence of fever and at
least one respiratory sign or symptom, with a history
of the person having traveled to places with local
transmission or contact with a confirmed case.11
However, fever is not necessarily present in all affected
individuals,7 considering that elderly people or even
people with no comorbidities have not presented
this specific sign. Moreover, the criterion for defining
fever is not standardized, whereby it can be measured
as temperature 37.5C,12 temperature 37.8C,7
recorded on medical records for hospitalized cases13 or
even reported by the individual without confirmation
by measuring their temperature.7
Be that as it may, the most common signs and
symptoms are considered to be fever (temperature
37.8C), coughing, dyspnea (breathing difficulty),
myalgia and fatigue.11 A study of 41 confirmed cases in
China identified that 98% of them had fever, followed
by coughing (76%), dyspnea (55%) and myalgia/fatigue
(44%).14 Wang et al.15 described 69 cases in China and
identified that some 15% of individuals analyzed had
fever, coughing and dyspnea. A case report in Seattle,
United States,13 showed that 50% of cases did not have
fever and that coughing and dyspnea were the most
reported symptoms, accounting for 88% of cases. In
findings for confirmed COVID-19 cases,16 the most
common clinical manifestations were fever (88.7%
[95%CI 84.5; 92.9%]), coughing (57.6% [95%CI 40.8;
74.4%]) and dyspnea (45.6% [95%CI 10.9; 80.4%]),
although they may not be present. Prevalence of fever
was greater in adults than in children.16

Suspected COVID-19 case definition
There are also reports of less common symptoms
that are hard to measure objectively, such as anosmia
(loss of sense of smell), hyposmia (reduction in sense
of smell) and ageusia (loss of sense of taste). Specialist
organizations propose that anosmia, hyposmia and
ageusia should be included as part of screening for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, principally in the absence of
other respiratory diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and
acute or chronic rhinosinusitis.17 There is evidence of
a significant number of people who developed these
symptoms and later had positive COVID-19 test results.18-20
A study with hospitalized individuals who tested positive
for COVID-19 in Italy19 found that 33.9% of them had
either changes to sense of smell or taste while 18.6%
had changes to both. Loss of sense of taste occurred
in 91% before they were hospitalized. These symptoms
were more frequently reported by women (52.6%
versus 25%) and by less elderly people (median of 56
years, IQR 47-60 years versus 66 years, IQR 52-77). In
Germany, anosmia was found in more than two thirds
of individuals studied, while Italian and Swiss doctors
are reporting similar symptoms, with many also having
ageusia. In South Korea, anosmia was the main symptom
in 30% of respondents with COVID-19.18
In a cross-sectional study with 204 laboratoryconfirmed cases in China,21 gastrointestinal symptoms
were reported by 50.5% at the time they were admitted to
hospital, in addition to fever and respiratory symptoms.
Their symptoms included ageusia, reported by 78.6%
of cases, diarrhea in 34% of cases, as well as vomiting
(3.9%) and abdominal pain (1.9%). In a retrospective
study conducted in the Chinese Province of Zhejiang,22
with 651 people hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19,
11.4% had gastrointestinal symptoms when they were
admitted to hospital. The most prevalent digestive
symptoms were diarrhea (71.62%), vomiting (14.86%)
and nausea (13.51%).
Diagnosis criteria
In the document entitled Guidelines for COVID-19
Diagnosis and Treatment, given the inespecificity and
heterogeneity of clinical presentation, the Ministry of
Health considers a confirmed case to be a case with
conclusive laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2,
regardless of signs or symptoms.11 However, in the
absence of confirmatory diagnostic tests for all suspect
cases, health services have had to adopt a very sensitive
suspect case definition, especially for cases with mild
symptoms, considering the symptoms reported by
individuals, in view of the recommendation for people
not to go to hospitals or health centers for clinical
evaluation, in the absence of breathing discomfort as
a sign of the disease becoming worse.8
As such, using the clinical/epidemiological criterion,
a suspect FS or SARS case is considered to be when
there is a history of close or household contact with a
laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case during the seven
days prior to onset of symptoms and when it was not
possible to perform specific laboratory investigation.
As such, any flu-like symptom has been considered
to indicate a suspect case, above all with the aim of
individual isolation so as to avoid virus transmission.
Notwithstanding, it is known that the majority of these
cases considered to be suspect will not be confirmed,
unless they get worse and need to be hospitalized, or
voluntarily have rapid tests available in some places.
According to the Ministry of Health, stratification
of the severity of suspect FS cases should take place
during a medical consultation, indicating that mild cases
(without dyspnea or signs and symptoms of severity)
can be accompanied completely by Primary Health
Care and Family Health Strategy (PHC/FHS) services in
view of these cases being less severe.8 Those who have
FS with dyspnea or signs and symptoms of severity, or
together with comorbidities that contraindicate home
isolation, need stabilization at in PHC/FHS services
and referral to Reference/Urgency/Hospital centers for
24-hour observation or interventions involving greater
technological density. For these people who seek care at
a health service facility, suspect findings in laboratory
tests and in images can be used as indications of the
disease, assisting with suspect case diagnosis.16,23
Molecular tests, such as reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which identify
SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, should be used between the 3rd
and 7th day of symptoms using nasopharyngeal secretion
samples, in order to ensure greater precision of the method
and to reduce false-negative results.24 Due to the high
them, RT-PCR tests are used for hospitalized symptomatic
individuals and health workers. Immunochromatographic
serological tests, known as rapid tests, have become
an option for people with light to moderate symptoms
who do not require hospitalization; for the general
population, when screening asymptomatic cases;6 and
Epidemiol. Serv. Saude, Braslia, 29(3):e2020233, 2020
Betine Pinto Moehlecke Iser et al.
for observing immunity/recovery of confirmed cases.
In this case, rapid tests should be used after seven days
following onset of symptoms.25
Development of a serological response to virus
infection depends on the host and takes time. In the case
of SARS-CoV-2, initial studies suggest that the majority
of cases seroconvert between 7 and 11 days following
exposure to the virus. As a result of this natural delay,
an antibody test may not be useful in the case of acute
disease or for early assessment of infection. Moreover,
the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests varies
according to the manufacturer. In general, the sensitivity
of the tests approved in Brazil by the National Health
Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) was greater than 85%,
and specificity was greater than 94%.4 It is important
to highlight that diagnostic tests with low sensitivity can
result in a higher proportion of false-negative results,
and this could interfere in the social isolation measures
adopted, principally for asymptomatic individuals, thus
having a direct influence on virus transmissibility.
As such, SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests can facilitate
contact screening; serological surveillance at the local,
regional, state and national level; and identification
of those who have already been exposed and may
possibly be immune, considering the existence of
protective immunity.
Characteristics of case severity
Some COVID-19 cases have serious complications,
leading to the need for care in intensive therapy units
(ITU) or even leading to death. According to the Ministry
of Health, besides the percentage of asymptomatic cases,
among those who have COVID-19, around 80% are mild
cases, 14% are severe cases and 5% are critical cases.7
As for more complex cases, they either progress from
the initial symptoms mentioned above, or they already
manifest SARS-CoV-2 infection through SARS, by having
dyspnea or clinical signs such as reduction in saturation
or cyanosis.8 In addition to the higher mortality rate due
to SARS, there is also a group considered to be at risk
because of greater lethality. Those belonging to this group
are: elderly people aged 60 and over, high-risk pregnant
women and people with a variety of comorbidities.9 As
such, individuals of all ages who have chronic diseases
related to the lungs, asthma, those who currently have
tuberculosis or sequelae of previous tuberculosis, diabetes,
hypertension, severe obesity, chronic kidney disease,
liver disease, immunodeficiency and heart problems
also belong to the risk group. Recent studies12,26-28
report diabetes mellitus, systemic arterial hypertension,
cerebrovascular disease and age as more decisive risk
factors in relation to hospitalization in ITUs and death.
A retrospective study that assessed neurological
aspects of confirmed COVID-19 cases29 indicated
that 41.1% were considered severe. Compared to the
milder cases, the severe cases were older individuals
(58.7  15.0 years versus 48.9  14.7 years), had
more comorbidities (42 [47.7%] versus 41 [32.5%]),
especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] versus 19 [15.1%]),
and had fewer symptoms considered to be typical, such
as fever (40 [45.5%] versus 92 [73%]) and coughing
(30 [34.1%] versus 77 [61.1%]).
Another study that described the characteristics
of cases that died compared to cases that recovered30
found at least one chronic disease with greater frequency
among cases that died (63% of those who died and
39% of those who recovered), whereby the main
diseases were: systemic arterial hypertension (48%),
cardiovascular diseases (14%) and cerebrovascular
diseases (4%), versus 24%, 4% and 0%, respectively,
in recovered cases. The following were also found to
be more frequent among those who died: dyspnea
(62% versus 31%), tight chest (49% versus 30%) and
loss of consciousness (22% versus 1%); lymphopenia
(39%) and leukocytosis (50%) (versus 5% and 4% of
those who recovered, respectively), saturation 93%
(64% versus 12%), tachycardia (50% versus 30%) and
tachypnea (27% versus 3%), as well as complications
that can arise from the length of time spent in ITUs and
the need for invasive procedures.
The study conducted by Wang et al.15 assessed 69
people with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and indicated
that all those who had saturation 90% (n= 14.20%)
died, and that those who died were older (median of
70.5 years versus 37 years), with comorbidities such
as systemic arterial hypertension (36% versus 7%),
cardiovascular disease (36% versus 5%) and diabetes
mellitus (43% versus 2%), and had a substantial
increase in inflammatory cytokines. Fever was evident
at the onset of symptoms (93% versus 85%) and on the
10th day of illness (64% versus 38%). Dyspnea (50%
versus 24%) and lymphopenia (79% versus 32%) were
also more frequent in this group.
A study that investigated the characteristics and the
prognosis factors of COVID-19 infection in a sample
Epidemiol. Serv. Saude, Braslia, 29(3):e2020233, 2020
Suspected COVID-19 case definition
comprised of 339 elderly people (60 years old)
with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results,30 found that the
number of critical and severe cases was greater in the
group analyzed compared to cases under 60 years
old. The study indicated that 23.6% were classified as
being in a critical state, while a further 46.9% were in
a severe state.30
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
carried out a study with 1,023 positive COVID-19
cases.23 Among those who became severely ill, the
most common clinical signs were dyspnea, respiratory
rate greater than 30 bpm and oxygen saturation under
93%. Among the more critical cases, the signs most
found were respiratory insufficiency, septic shock and
dysfunction or failure of multiple organs. Lethality was
2.3% in that sample. However, if only the lethality of
the critical cases were assessed, the proportion would
be much higher, i.e. 49%.
the most common signs and symptoms by sex and age,
although age is more related to the diseases severity
criteria. It is important to consider that signs and
symptoms can vary between the stages of the disease,
oscillating between absence of signs and symptoms and
septic shock, when the clinical picture becomes worse.
It should also be noted that in addition to the diversity
of clinical manifestations, some 80% of infected people
can remain asymptomatic. It is therefore suggested that
suspect cases should be monitored constantly, in view
of the manifestations of diverse symptoms, so as not to
rule out cases by only considering clinical presentation
which, in many cases, is subjective.
Given the imminence of Brazil becoming the worlds
new epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is suggested
that health services opt for over-reporting, considering
the high sensitivity of the surveillance system, so that
whenever signs and symptoms appear that may be
related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, isolation measures
can be indicated for cases and their contacts, in
addition to constant real-time monitoring, based on
case investigation and local epidemiological reality. In
addition, health services can establish, based on the
cases they care for, a set of signs and symptoms that
best defines their cases and which guides screening
in accordance with the specific situation. Use of
telemedicine is a fundamental tool in providing care
to suspect and confirmed cases that can stay at home,
so as to accompany the progression of their clinical
presentation and identify early any worsening of the
case, so that appropriate measures can be taken.
Whenever possible, it is essential to use molecular or
serological diagnostic tests, depending on the day the
symptoms started, in addition to laboratory tests and
image examinations, to confirm diagnosis of COVID-19.
Final considerations
against it using the best available evidence. Due to its
multiple presentations in all age ranges, the concept
of diagnosis continues to be very broad and sensitive,
so that it is not possible to define so much as a single
obligatory sign/symptom for determining presence of
infection. Nevertheless, it appears to be consensus that
people with existing comorbidities and people who are
older are susceptible to being more intensely affected
and having worse disease progression, so that they need
to be targeted with preventive actions.
Considering the high percentage of asymptomatic
people and people with mild symptoms, who will not
be completely captured by the surveillance system, by
means of investigation and laboratory confirmation, health
services need to take great care with regard to symptom
heterogeneity and clinical presentation of the disease. In
this situation, nonpharmaceutical prevention measures
need to be adopted for the entire population, including
wearing facemasks, constant sanitization of hands and
environments, in addition to social distancing. It also
continues to be essential to increase access to diagnostic
tests, in order to have knowledge of the epidemiological
situation in each place and achieve better guidance of
measures to control virus dissemination.
Brazil continues to be in a state of alert, with the aim
of slowing down the new case infection curve so as not
to overburden the health system. Further studies need to
be conducted so that the case definition becomes more
precise in relation to signs and symptoms, assisting
classification of the population and guiding the gradual
return to routine activities, while complying with indicated
protection measures, with the aim of minimizing the
consequences of the pandemic.
