death in patients at risk for COVID-19 presenting for urgent care during the Massachusetts outbreak.
Methods. Single-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics (RICs) or the
emergency department (ED), including development (n = 9381, March 7-May 2) and prospective (n =
2205, May 3-14) cohorts. Data was queried from Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse. Outcomes were
hospitalization, critical illness or death within 7 days. We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score
(CoVA) using automatically extracted data from the electronic medical record and learning-to-rank
ordinal logistic regression modeling. Calibration was assessed using predicted-to-observed ratio (E/O).
Discrimination was assessed by C-statistics (AUC).
Results. In the development cohort, 27.3%, 7.2%, and 1.1% of patients experienced hospitalization,
critical illness, or death, respectively; and in the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5%. CoVA
showed excellent performance in the development cohort (concurrent validation) for hospitalization (E/O:
1.00, AUC: 0.80); for critical illness (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.82); and for death (E/O: 1.00, AUC: 0.87).
Performance in the prospective cohort (prospective validation) was similar for hospitalization (E/O: 1.01,
AUC: 0.76); for critical illness (E/O 1.03, AUC: 0.79); and for death (E/O: 1.63, AUC=0.93). Among 30
predictors, the top five were age, diastolic blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, COVID-19 testing
status, and respiratory rate.
related to COVID-19 infection in the outpatient setting.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unparalleled challenges for healthcare systems around the
world[18]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The first US case
was confirmed on January 20[9], followed by exponential spread within the US[10]. By the end of April,
Massachusetts was the third hardest hit state, trailing only New York and New Jersey[11]. Within
Massachusetts, Boston and Chelsea were epicenters for the spread of COVID-19.
In anticipation of the surge of COVID-19 patients and to help limit viral spread, Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) closed most outpatient and urgent care clinics and set up new Respiratory Illness Clinics
(RICs) on March 7, 2020 to manage patients with symptoms of a respiratory infection. These clinics were
staffed by clinicians and nurses reassigned from other areas, most with little urgent care experience.
COVID-19 suspected cases were also screened in the Emergency Department (ED). Due to high case
volumes and precautions for staff and patients, visit duration and extent of clinical assessments for most
patients were curtailed. In addition to limited clinical assessment, triage decisions were complicated by
COVID-19s biphasic clinical course. Patients who initially present with mild symptoms often later return
for hospital admission, and many subsequently suffer adverse events including ICU transfer, mechanical
ventilation (MV) or death. Various prediction rules have been proposed, but to our knowledge few have
been prospectively validated, and most were developed for the inpatient setting rather than outpatient
To help frontline clinicians appropriately triage and plan follow-up care for patients presenting for
COVID-19 screening and not requiring immediate hospitalization, we developed an outpatient screening
score, COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA), that could be incorporated into an electronic medical record
(EMR) system. We used data from MGHs newly formed RIC clinics and the emergency department.
CoVA assigns acuity levels based on demographic, clinical, radiographic, and medical history variables,
and provides predicted probabilities for hospital admission, ICU admission or MV, or death within 7
Study Population
We included data from patients seen in MGH RIC clinics and ED between March 7 and May 14. Patients
were divided into two mutually exclusive cohorts, a development cohort (March 7 to May 2, 2020, n =
9381); and prospective cohort (May 3 to May 14, 2020, n = 2205).
Inclusion criteria were: (1) MGH RIC or ED visit between March 7th and May 14th, 2020; (2) age  18
years; and (3) reason for visit was cough, fever, shortness of breath, COVID-related, or potentially related
swab without a clinical assessment were excluded; and (2) Patients with visits in both development and
prospective cohorts are excluded, to ensure the score is not overfit to those patients. A data flowchart is
development cohort, we randomly sampled one visit from each patient. In the prospective cohort, we
chose the most recent visit from each patient.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was the occurrence of an adverse event within 7 days following an outpatient
medical encounter, including either hospitalization at MGH, critical illness (defined as ICU care and/or
mechanical ventilation), or death. The prediction horizon was set to 7 days because this period was
considered meaningful by our frontline teams for clinical decision-making (e.g., regarding whether to
send a patient home or to the emergency department, or to follow up with phone calls), and because
empirically, within the model development cohort most adverse events occurred within 7 days of initial
We selected 98 variables that were routinely available in the outpatient setting during the COVID-19
pandemic to serve as candidate predictors. These included demographic variables: age, gender, tobacco
use history, most recent body mass index (BMI) within the preceding month (represented as binary
variables designated as high BMI, >35kg/m2, and low BMI, <18.5kg/m2), the most recent vital signs
(blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2)) within the
preceding 3 days; COVID testing status (See Supplemental Section Predictor encoding for encoding
details); specific symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (anosmia, dysgeusia based on ICD-10 codes), and
pre-existing medical diagnoses, coded as present or absent based on groups of billing codes (ICD-10
recorded on or before the day of presentation. The Weighted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was
computed based on groups of ICDs using the wscore from the R package comorbidity[14]. We
omitted race and ethnicity as predictors because (1) we have found that these variables were often
unavailable or inaccurately recorded, especially ethnicity; and (2) we wanted to limit the influence of
local demographic patterns on the score, which might limit the ability to generalize to external
For patients who underwent chest X-ray (CXR) imaging during these encounters, we identified groups of
extracted key words, phrases, and word patterns describing abnormal findings. Next, a pulmonary and
critical care medicine physician (LB) categorized these phrases into groups. Five groups were identified:
multifocal, patterns typical for COVID-19 (pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS)), patchy consolidation, peripheral or interstitial opacity, or hazy or airspace opacities.
not present or unavailable.
Data Preprocessing and Selection of Predictor Variables
S5). Unavailable values were imputed using K-nearest neighbors (KNN)[15], where the value of K was
determined by minimizing the imputation error on a subset without unavailable data by randomly
masking variables according to the pattern of unavailability in the overall data. Note that we did not
impute CXR predictors or COVID status for patients who did not have either of them available. Instead,
for these we coded unavailability explicitly (described above).
Predictors were standardized to zero mean and unit standard deviation using z-score transformation
we used ANOVA statistics to identify predictors associated with hospitalization, ICU care or MV, or
death. At 0.05 significance level, we identified 65 predictors to carry forward into the model fitting
selection (LASSO) regression during the model fitting procedure to select a reduced subset of highly
predictive variables.
Model Development
We assigned an ordinal scale to adverse events, including no event, hospitalized, ICU care and/or MV,
and death. We used an implementation of ordinal regression: pairwise learning to rank (LTR) with
LASSO penalized logistic regression[16,17]. Training involves learning to predict which of a pair of
patients will have a worse outcome. On biological grounds, and to address co-linearity among predictors,
we constrained the model optimization to allow only non-negative coefficients for CXR predictors,
medical comorbidities, CCI, and history of current or past tobacco use; and unconstrained for other
predictors. Model training and preliminary evaluation of model performance was performed using the
development cohort, using nested 5-fold cross validation (CV) (Supplemental Materials and
probabilities for hospitalization and for critical illness or death within 7 days. The final model was tested
on the prospective validation cohort. Performance is reported both for the development cohort (results
from cross validation), and for the prospective cohort.
Statistical Analysis of CoVA Predictive Performance
We summarized the distribution of cohort characteristics and adverse events using event counts and
proportions for categorical predictors, and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. For
model calibration, an expected-to-observed ratio (E/O)[18] of 1.0 indicates that the number of expected
events equals the number of observed events; and calibration slope (CS) is defined as the linear
correlation between the observed O and expected probabilities E, where the expected (predicted) values
(E) are binned into quintiles.
We calculated the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC, also called the Cstatistic) to quantify how well CoVA scores discriminate between individuals who within 7 days were vs.
not hospitalized, and between those who did vs. not experience critical illness (ICU care, MV, or death).
We considered an AUC between 0.50 and 0.55 to be poor; 0.55 and 0.65, moderate; 0.65 and 0.75,
negative predictive values (NPV) at the 90% sensitivity level.
We also looked at the time course of adverse events as a function of CoVA score over 4 weeks (28 days)
following initial presentation to the RIC or ED to understand the properties of CoVA score.
Cohort Characteristics
From March 7 to May 2, 2020, 9381 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the development
cohort. The average age was 51 years old with 49% being female. Among these, 3344 (35.6%) had
adverse events within 7 days of presentation: 2562 (27.3%) were hospitalized, 679 (7.2%) received ICU
care and/or were mechanically ventilated, and 103 (1.1%) died.
From May 3-14, 2205 additional patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the prospective
cohort. The average age was 53 years old with 49% being female. Among these, 726 (32.9%) had adverse
events: 575 (26.1%) were hospitalized, 139 (6.3%) received ICU care and/or were mechanically
ventilated, and 12 (0.5%) died.
prospective validation period there were modest increases in the proportion of patients with CXRs
(prospective 52.3% vs. development 41.0%), the proportion of outpatient evaluations performed in RIC
clinics (prospective 26.5% vs. development 21.4%), and in testing rates for COVID-19 (prospective
78.8% vs. development 59.5%). Several other small but likely clinically insignificant differences between
cohorts also reached statistical significance, due to the large cohort sizes. COVID-19 infections and

(E/O: 1.00 [ 0.98, 1.02], CS: 0.99 [0.98, 0.99], AUC: 0.80 [0.79 , 0.81]); for critical illness (E/O: 1.00
[0.93, 1.06], CS: 0.98 [0.96, 0.99], AUC: 0.82 [0.80 , 0.83]); and for death (E/O: 1.00 [0.84, 1.21], CS:
not calculated due to small sample size; AUC: 0.87 [0.83, 0.91]). Performance generalized to the
prospective validation cohort, with similar results for hospitalization (E/O: 1.01 [0.96 , 1.07], CS: 0.99
[0.98, 1.00], AUC 0.76 [ 0.73 , 0.78]); for critical illness (E/O: 1.03 [0.89 , 1.20], CS: 0.98 [0.94, 1.00],
AUC: 0.79 [0.75 , 0.82]); and for death (E/O: 1.63 [1.03, 3.25], CS: not calculated due to small sample
Properties of COVA Score
The proportion of patients with adverse events at 7 days increases with higher CoVA scores, rising from
18% with CoVA scores in the 0-20 range, to 88% for those with scores in the 80-100 range. The
proportion underwent critical illness or death also rises, from 2% for scores between 0-20, to 32% with
We investigated the time course of adverse events as a function of CoVA score over 4 weeks (28 days)
following initial presentation to the RIC or ED. We limited this investigation to the development cohort,
because 28 days have not passed for the prospective validation cohort at the time of writing. By 28 days,
3399 (36%) of patients experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death. Of these, 3214 (95%)
occurred within 1 day, and 3344 (98%) had occurred by 7 days. Critical illness or death occurred in 861
(9%) of patients within 28 days of presentation. Of these, 537 (62%) occurred within 1 day, and 782
(91%) occurred within 7 days. These numbers support our choice of 7 days as a clinically meaningful
event prediction horizon. Curves for the cumulative incidence of adverse events over time for different
Predictors of Adverse Events
predictors increase the predicted probability of adverse events when present. SpO2, diastolic and systolic
blood pressure and low BMI inversely correlated with the probability of adverse events. Predictors from
CXR reports included in the model were multifocal patterns (diffuse opacities, ground glass) and patterns
typical for COVID.
Effect of Chest X-Ray Findings and COVID Status on the Probability of Adverse Events
CXRs and testing for COVID-19 were not universal, and testing rates evolved over time. One potential
use of CoVA is to help determine whether to perform these tests. We therefore investigated the impact of
S4, positive CXR findings are most informative when the pre-CXR probability is 30% (critical illness or
death), in which case they increase the predicted probability of an adverse event by 4%. Negative CXR
findings are maximally informative when the pretest probability is near 34% (critical illness or death), in
which case they decrease the probability by 4%.
We also examined the effect of COVID-19 testing results on the predicted probability of adverse events
(critical illness or death). The largest effect of a positive test result occurs when pretest probability is
28%, in which case the post-test probability increases by 8%. A negative result has the largest impact
when pretest probability is 36%, in which case the posttest probability decreases by 8%.
Identifying outpatients presenting for COVID-19 screening at high risk or low risk for adverse events is
important for medical decisions regarding testing, hospitalization, and follow-up. We developed and
score that can be implemented in the EMR. The model exhibits excellent calibration, discrimination, and
negative predictive value both in concurrent validation (n = 9381, March 7-May 2) and in large-scale
prospective validation (n = 2205, May 3-14). While several COVID-19 risk prediction models have been
proposed for the inpatient setting, CoVA fills an unmet need for a prospectively validated risk designed
for outpatient screening.
Several predictors selected into the model have been identified in prior studies, including advanced
age[4,5,9,19]; pre-existing pulmonary[4,5], kidney[4], and cardiovascular disease[4,9,20]; obesity[21];
and increased respiratory or heart rate or hypoxia[4]. We found that other pre-existing medical conditions
also increased risk for adverse outcomes, including hematologic malignancy, cancer and pancreatitis.
Hypertension and diabetes mellitus did not emerge as predictors in the CoVA model, despite being
identified in prior studies[4, 5, 9]. These comorbidities are correlated with outcomes in univariate analysis

Several studies have documented neurological manifestation of COVID-19[2224]. Nevertheless, we
were surprised to find a variety of neurological diseases surfaced as robust predictors of adverse outcomes
in COVID-19 infection, including ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage,
epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and spinal muscular atrophy. It is unclear if
these neurological diseases are merely markers of health or if the worsened outcomes are due to the
interaction of COVID-19 with neurological disorders that amplifies the pathology.
our study, most have attempted to predict critical illness or death. However, most are based on small
cohorts (median: n = 189, range n = 26 to 577); focus on inpatients; and utilize laboratory values, which
were rarely available for our outpatient cohort. Only 3 included prospective or external validation. By
contrast, CoVA is designed for the outpatient setting. In this setting, the availability of COVID-19 test
results are variably available (for 60% in the development and 80% in the prospective cohort) and other
laboratory results were rarely available. To ensure generalizability, we used a large development cohort of
9381 patients, and trained the model using a rigorous approach. We ensured clinical interpretability by
utilizing a linear model with positivity constraints on predictors expected to increase risk. Finally, we
validated our model on a large (n = 2205) prospectively collected patient cohort, providing an unbiased
assessment of model generalizability.
Strengths of this study include its large sample size, careful EMR phenotyping, rigorous statistical
approach, and the feature that all variables required by the model are available and automatically
from a single center, with patient demographics specific to MGH, Boston. Nevertheless, important
biological parameters in the predictive model are universal and increase the likelihood that the model will
generalize. Second, although RIC clinics were established for patients with suspicion for COVID-19,
patients seen in the ED were seen for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless COVID-19 was and for now
remains a universal concern for patients seen in the ED, and we excluded patients prior to the onset of
COVID-19 in Boston (March 7, 2020), therefore our model is relevant for screening during times of high
alert for COVID-19. Finally, we did not include lab test values, since they were typically not available.
Among the few studies of inpatients, inclusion of lab tests appears to improve model performance.
In conclusion, the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) represents a well-calibrated, discriminative,
presenting with possible COVID-19 infection.
