The  Rwandan  Civil  War was a civil war in Rwanda fought between
the Rwandan Armed Forces, representing the government of  Rwanda,
and  the  rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) from 1 October 1990
to 18 July 1994. The war arose from the longrunning  dispute   be
tween  the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. A
1959 ‐ 1962 revolution had replaced the  Tutsi  monarchy  with  a
Hutu  led   republic,   forcing  more  than 336,000 Tutsi to seek
refuge in neighbouring countries. A  group  of   these   refugees
in   Uganda  founded  the RPF which, under the leadership of Fred
Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, became a battleready army by  the  late
1980s.    The war  began  on  1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded
northeastern Rwanda, advancing 60 km (37 mi)  into  the  country.
They  suffered a major  setback  when  Rwigyema was killed in ac‐
tion on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from
France,  gained the upper  hand and the RPF were largely defeated
by the end of Octo ber. Kagame, who had been in the United States
during   the   inva  sion,  returned to take command. He withdrew
troops to the Virunga Mountains for several months before attack‐
ing  again. The RPF  be gan  a guerrilla war, which continued un‐
til mid1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A  se‐
ries   of  protests  forced Rwandan  President Juvnal Habyarimana
to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic  opposition
parties. Despite  disruption and  killings by Hutu Power, a group
of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF  offensive  in
early  1993,   the   negotiations  were   successfully  concluded
with the signing of the Arusha Ac cords in August 1993.
