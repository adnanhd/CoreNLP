Objective It has been hypothesised that the use
of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) might either increase or reduce the risk of severe
or lethal COVID-19. The findings from the available
observational studies varied, and summary estimates
are urgently needed to elucidate whether these drugs
should be suspended during the pandemic, or patients
and physicians should be definitely reassured. This
meta-­analysis of adjusted observational data aimed
to summarise the existing evidence on the association
between these medications and severe/lethal COVID-19.
Methods We searched MedLine, Scopus and preprint
repositories up to 8 June 2020 to retrieve cohort or
case–control studies comparing the risk of severe/fatal
COVID-19 (either mechanical ventilation, intensive care
unit admission or death), among hypertensive subjects
treated with: (1) ACE inhibitors, (2) ARBs and (3) both,
versus untreated subjects. Data were combined using a
random-­effect generic inverse variance approach.
Results Ten studies, enrolling 9890 hypertensive
subjects were included in the analyses. Compared with
untreated subjects, those using either ACE inhibitors or
ARBs showed a similar risk of severe or lethal COVID-19
(summary OR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26 for ACE
inhibitors; 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12 for ARBs). The
results did not change when both drugs were considered
together, when death was the outcome and excluding
the studies with significant, divergent results.
Conclusion The present meta-­analysis strongly
supports the recommendation of several scientific
societies to continue ARBs or ACE inhibitors for all
patients, unless otherwise advised by their physicians
who should thus be reassured.

With the spread of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-­CoV-2) pandemic,
evidence is rapidly accumulating on the risk factors
of severe COVID-19 and death. In the wake of
some preliminary, unadjusted reports,1–4 individuals with pre-­
existing comorbidities such as
hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases
have been identified as those highly vulnerable.5
Notably, such chronic conditions frequently require
prescription of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II
receptor blockers (ARBs).6 Animal studies showed
that ACE inhibitors and ARBs upregulate ACE2
expression7 and, as coronaviruses bind their target
cells through ACE2, concerns have been expressed
that these therapies might facilitate infection with
SARS-­CoV-2 and increase the risk of severe or fatal
COVID-19.6 8 In contrast, it has been suggested that
ACE inhibitors and ARBs could benefit infected
patients, as ACE2 converts angiotensin II (with
known vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory and
fibrotic effects) into angiotensin 1–7, which may
protect lungs from acute injury, and upregulating
ACE2 through therapy may enhance this process.9
In this uncertain scenario, some observational
studies with multivariable analyses found no association between use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and COVID-19
severity,10–16 a few studies found a significant
reduction in the risk of death or severe disease17 18
and one study found a increased risk of mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU).19 The magnitude of the association also
varied across studies, which differed for patients’
characteristics, setting (inpatient or outpatient),
population targeted by serological testing protocols
and extent of measured confounding.
Summary estimates are urgently needed to elucidate whether these drugs, that are prescribed to
tens of millions patients worldwide,20 should be
suspended during the pandemic, or patients and
physicians should be definitely reassured.7 We thus
carried out a meta-­analysis to summarise the existing
evidence from adjusted analyses on the association
between RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19.
Bibliographic search, data extraction and quality
We searched MEDLINE and Scopus databases, up
to 11 May 2020, for studies evaluating the risk of
severe and/or fatal COVID-19 among ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs users versus non-­
users. The
following search strategy was adopted, without
language restrictions: COVID-19 [Title/Abstract]

was also screened for additional pertinent papers.
In the context of a public health emergency, there is
urgency to make research findings available,21 and
several relevant clinical data have been shared in
public preprint repositories: we thus extended the
in MedRxiv. Inclusion criteria were: (A) cohort or

contacted (LM), and consensus was achieved through discussion.
Individual study quality was assessed using an adapted version
of the Newcastle Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale, assessing
the comparability across groups for confounding factors, the
appropriateness of outcome assessment, length of follow-­up and
missing data handling and reporting.22
Data analysis
Data were combined using a random-­effect generic inverse variance approach23 in order to account for between-­study heterogeneity. Missing SEs were computed from 95% CIs following
standard Cochrane methodology. If a paper reported the results
of different multivariable models, the most stringently controlled
estimates (those from the model adjusting for more factors) were
extracted. If different models controlled for the same number of
covariates, the model containing the most clinically meaningful
covariates was used for the analysis.24
study heterogeneity was quantified using the I2
statistic. Potential publication bias was assessed graphically,
using funnel plots (displaying the Relative Risks from individual
comparisons versus their precision (1/SE). Given that the total
number of publications included for each outcome was <10,
we could not use formal tests for funnel plot asymmetry: in
such cases, the power is too low to distinguish chance from real

ascertainment of the exposure and the evaluation of the comparability of subjects were adequate in all studies, while 8 out of
10 adequately addressed the items pertaining to outcome assessment and follow-­up (length and missing data). One study had a
high risk of misclassification bias, as the proportions of hypertensive subjects treated with ACE inhibitors (16.4%) or ARBs
(13.2%) were particularly low.19
Risk of severe/lethal COVID-19
A total of five studies, enrolling 7489 hypertensive patients,
were included in the meta-­analysis comparing the risk of severe/
lethal COVID-19 between ACE inhibitors users versus non-­
or lethal disease was comparable among treated and untreated
patients (summary OR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26). Two studies
showed significant results, with opposite direction. The first
included 682 hypertensive subjects and showed an increased
risk of severe illness among the 112 patients treated with ACE
inhibitors.19 The second enrolled 105 hypertensive subjects and
reported a lower risk among the 38 treated patients.17 Excluding
one or both of these studies did not change the results, which
remained non-­significant (all p>0.05).
Five studies, enrolling 7462 hypertensive subjects, were
included in the meta-­analysis comparing the risk of severe illness
All of them showed non-­significant differences between treated
and untreated patients, with a summary OR of 0.92; 95% CI
When the above antihypertensive treatments were considered together (five studies, enrolling 11 334 hypertensive
patients),10 11 14 15 19 the risk of developing severe COVID-19
was again comparable between treated and untreated patients
Risk of death from COVID-19
The risk of death among RAAS inhibitors users versus non-­
users was compared in four studies, including a total of 2412
and ARBs users, versus non users, in predicting: (1) severe/lethal
COVID-19 (presence of either ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death) and (2) lethal COVID-19. When a study only
reported separate estimates for ACE inhibitors or ARBs users, or
for the different outcomes included in the definition of severe/
lethal COVID-19 (eg, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation
separately), the overall estimate of risk was computed from the
separate relative risks using the fixed-­effect model for generic
inverse variance outcomes.24

almost 10 000 hypertensive subjects: first, no significant differences in the risk of developing severe or fatal COVID-19 were
observed between the subjects treated with either ACE inhibitors or ARBs, as compared with non-­users. Second, and importantly, the results did not change after the exclusion of the three
studies, which reported either a significantly higher or lower risk
of severe illness among treated patients.
The present findings provide solid evidence from properly
adjusted estimates across different countries on the absence
of risk from RAAS inhibitors treatment during the pandemic,
strongly supporting the statements of several experts27 28 and
scientific societies, including the European Medicines Agency,29
the European Society of Cardiology30 and the American Heart
Association,31 who recommend continuation of ARBs or ACE
inhibitors medication. Although the present findings do not
support the hypothesis of a beneficial effect from therapy during
the necessary time required for randomised data to come,
patients and physicians can be reassured.
Some limitations should be considered when interpreting
the present findings. First, two meta-­
analyses showed an
intermediate-­to-­high level of heterogeneity. However, a certain
large variation in terms of setting and baseline patients characteristics. Also, when the analyses were repeated adopting a fixed
approach, none of the results substantially differed (except for
CIs, which were typically tighter). Second, although all studies
(with a single exception)13 provided analyses at least adjusted for
versus non-­users.
age, gender and several underlying comorbidities, some extent of
residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out, as for any
observational study.32 Third, as shown in the funnel plots in the
more than five studies, thus it was not possible to perform a
meaningful evaluation of publication bias. However, given the
public health relevance of these data, it is unlikely that non-­
significant findings—with reassuring implications—have been
withheld. Rather, it is certain that large dataset will be available
soon. Given the urgency for millions of patients, we decided not
to wait, but the present meta-­analysis will have to be updated as
inclusion bias, due to the presence of multiple effect estimates
that can be extracted from individual studies,33 is likely to be
low, as only one of the included studies reported more than an
adjusted estimate,18 and the results of the meta-­analysis including
the alternate estimate of effect were unchanged (pooled OR of
death 0.88; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.13).
Acknowledging these caveats, the present meta-­analysis, based
on 10 studies and almost 10 000 hypertensive subjects, did not
find any association between COVID-19 severity or mortality
and treatment with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or both, strongly
supporting the recommendation of several scientific societies
to continue ARBs or ACE inhibitors medication for all patients,
unless otherwise advised by their physicians, who should thus
be reassured.

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
Key messages
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive subjects showed
an increased mortality and morbidity among hypertensive
patients, who were frequently treated with ACE inhibitors
or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Recently, some
observational studies with multivariable analyses found
no association between these medications and COVID-19
severity, a few studies found a significant reduction in the risk
of death or severe disease and one study found a increased
risk of mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive
care unit. The magnitude of the association also varied across
studies, which differed for patients’ characteristics, setting
(inpatient or outpatient), population targeted by serological
testing protocols and extent of measured confounding.
What might this study add?
►► This meta-­analysis is based on 10 adjusted observational
studies (enrolling almost 10 000 hypertensive subjects), from
different countries, and provides the first summary estimate
on the association between ACE inhibitors or ARBs use
and COVID-19 severity or mortality. All analyses showed a
comparable risk of severe or fatal illness among treated and
untreated subjects, either considering ACE inhibitors or ARBs
separately, or combined.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
►► Given that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are prescribed to tens
of millions patients worldwide, summary estimates were
strongly needed to elucidate whether these drugs should be
suspended during the pandemic, or patients and physicians
should be definitely reassured. These findings strongly
support the recommendation of several scientific societies to
continue ARBs or ACE inhibitors medication for all patients,
unless otherwise advised by their physicians.
