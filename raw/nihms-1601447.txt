Introduction: While the global COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the entire humanity and
health systems, it also triggered researchers to urgently perform clinical trials to assess the safety
and efficacy of many agents and modalities to combat COVID-19. As of April 22, over 650
clinical studies have been registered both in USA and internationally. Results from these studies
are also coming at a brisk pace in this unprecedented emergency.
Areas covered: We searched the NCI website and Medline and summarize various national and
international clinical trials and summarize few of the pivotal ones in this paper, including those
specific to oncology population. Two hundred and eighty four studies are actively recruiting adults
and children with confirmed COVID-19, including 25 are early-phase I/phase I, 72 phase II, 58
phase III, 12 phase IV, and 31 other trials. They can be categorized into four groups: drugs that
combat SARS-CoV-2, immunomodulatory agents to counteract cytokine storm, convalescence
plasma therapies and vaccines trials.
Expert opinion: It is hoped that these efforts will results in a successful treatment to COVID-19,
especially in a timely fashion before the second pandemic expected in fall. It is essential to
acknowledge the devotion and hard work of the clinical research team and clinical research

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was first detected in Wuhan, China in
December 2019. Since then it has spread to more than 200 countries. As of April 20, 2020,
there have been more than 2.5 million reported cases and 170,000 deaths worldwide [1].
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense, single-strand enveloped RNA virus that shares close
genetic similarity to corona viruses from previous outbreaks - the severe acute respiratory
Chi et al.
syndrome corona virus (SARS-COV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV). The common manifestations from COVID-19 are cough (86.1%), fever or
chills (85.0%), and shortness of breath (80.0%) which are very similar to influenza but the
case fatality rate of COVID-19 is much high and estimated to be at 3–10%. Diabetes
mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, and obesity are some of
the prevalent conditions that may increase the risk of hospitalizations [2]. The severe cases
of COVID-19 with high mortality are associated with reduced innate and adaptive immune
responses in conjunction with abundant cytokine and overexpression of interleukin 6 (IL-6)
[3,4]. These patients present with lymphopenia with markedly decreased number of CD4
and CD8 T cells, natural killer cells and monocytes [4]. The United States Food and Drug
“compassionate use” in treating patients with COVID 19.
Although there are many ongoing clinical trials, currently there is no strong evidence from
clinical trials, treatment strategies, and clinical experience in treating COVID-19 with a
focus on oncology patients.
The Current Landscape of Clinical Trials for COVID-19
Currently there are 657 registered clinical trials related to SARS-CoV-2 as of April 20th,
2020. Of these trials, 284 are actively recruiting adults and children with confirmed
COVID-19 for in-patient and outpatient pharmacological interventions. Of the 284 trials, 25
are Early-phase I/Phase I, 72 Phase II, 58 Phase III, 12 Phase IV, and 31 other trials. They
can be categorized into 1) drugs that combat SARS-CoV-2, 2) immunomodulatory agents to
Trials with Drugs against SARS-CoV-2 Viral Replication
Many agents in this category are already approved by the FDA for treating other diseases.
They have generally have proven safety profile and tolerability from previous clinical
experience. In vitro studies of these agents showed antiviral activities against SARS-VoV-2
Chloroquine and its derivative, Hydroxychloroquine, have been widely used to treat malarial
and autoimmune disease. Chloroquine blocks virus infection by raising endosomal pH
required for virus-cell fusion and interferes with SARS-CoV-1 receptor glycosylation [5]. It
has also been shown to have similar inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 [6]. A recent
Chinese study showed that Hydroxychloroquine was more potent and tolerable than
chloroquine in vitro [7]. In a recent open-label, non-randomized trial, Gautret et al. showed
significant reduction in viral load in COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine
[8]. Another observational study with 1061 patients who received hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin showed good viral clearance and safety profile [9]. Currently, there are 101
clinical trials worldwide using hydroxychloroquine either by itself or in combination with
other agents for treating COVID-19 [10].
Chi et al.
Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue. It causes premature termination of viral RNA
replication when incorporated into growing RNA. It was initially developed as a trial drug
for treatment of Ebola during the height of Ebola outbreak. However, the phase 3
randomized trial yielded negative result [11]. Nevertheless, it showed significant in vitro
antiviral activity against a wide array of RNA viruses in the Flaviviridae and Corona viridae
family including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and most recently SARS-CoV-2 [6]. There have
been reports of anecdotal successful use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients [12,13].
Currently there are many ongoing clinical trials (e.g. NCT04292899, NCT04292730) to
evaluate the efficacy of remdesivir in patients with mild to moderate or severe COVID-19.
For severe patients, the data for the first 400 patients in the study was finished, will be
released any day (NCT04292899).
Lopinavir-ritonavir is an FDA approved combination antiviral medication used to treat and
prevent HIV. It was used in the 2003 SARS outbreak and associated reduced mortality and
intubation rates [14]. In terms of COVID-19, early case reports and observational studies
showed mix results [14]. However, a recent open label randomized trial in China with 199
patients with COVID-19 failed to show significant difference in viral clearance or 28-day
mortality rates [15]. Although there are additional RCTs ongoing, the current data suggest a
limited role of the drug in COVID-19 treatment.
Arbidol (Umifenovir) targets S protein/ACE2 interaction, then inhibits membrane fusion of
the viral envelope. It is approved for treatment of influenza in China and Russia. There are
total of 4 trials available with 2 recruiting for COVID-19 patients.
Camostat mesylate inhibits transmembrane serine protease and prevents viral cell entry. It is
primarily used to treat postoperative reflux esophagitis and acute pancreatitis in Japan. There
are 4 trials available with 2 recruiting for CoViD-19 patients.
Immunomodulatory Agents against Cytokine Storm
One of the hallmarks of COVID-19 disease course is that is that the patients can rapidly
develop acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple-organ failure leading to death.
Overwhelming cytokine storm is one to the major contributors to the rapid clinical decline.
Potent cytokines such as interleukin (IL) −1, IL2, IL-6, TNFa, IFN-α, β were noted to be
markedly elevated in these patients. Various immunomodulatory agents are being studied in
patients with severe COVID-19 to abate the cytokine storm.
Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, approved for treatment of cytokine storm due to
CAR-T cell therapy, giant cell arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has been used to treat
severe COVID-19 patients with cytokine storm. A report of 21 COVID-19 patients treated
with tocilizumab showed improvements in terms of respiratory function, rapid
deffervescence and early hospital discharge [16]. Ongoing clinical trials include
NCT04310228, ChiCTR200002976. Sarilumab, another IL-6 receptor antagonist approved
for RA, is also being studied in clinical trials (e.g. NCT04288713) in hospitalized patients
Chi et al.
Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) approved for RA and neonatal onset
multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). It can block IL-1 and the downstream
inflammatory effects, decreasing/stopping the cytokine storm. It is being studied in clinical
trials NCT04339712, NCT04341584. It is also being studied in combination with
emapalumab (NCT04324021), a monoclonal antibody against IFN-γ approved for refractory
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
Roxolitinib is an inhibitor of Janus Kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 approved for the treatment of
myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and graft-versus-host disease. The JAK pathway is a
potential target as IFN-γ exerts its inflammatory effects via the JAK/STAT pathway. It can
block the downstream effects of IFN-γ and other cytokines reducing inflammation.
Currently there are ongoing clinical trials (NCT04331665, NCT04338958) to study its
efficacy in COVID-19 patients.
Selinexor, a nuclear export protein (XPO1) inhibitor approved for treatment of relapsed/
refractory multiple myeloma is another potential agent to treat COVID-19 patients. Zhou et
al. showed that both SAR-CoV-2 propagation in host cells and inflammatory transcription
factors require functional nuclear transport protein XPO1 [17]. Selinexor can potentially
stop viral replication and cytokine storm at the same time. Its efficacy in COVID-19 patients
is being evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT04349098).
Acalabrutinib is a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved for treatment of
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. BTK is a key regulator of
production of multiple cytokines and chemokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1
identified as elevated in severe COVID-19 patients. A new study in Spain is underway
(NCT04346199) to study acalaburtinib in COVID-19 patients.
Convalescent plasma
The use of convalescent plasma and passive immunization has been studied in the treatment
of respiratory viral illnesses (influenza, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and preliminary data
suggests that convalescent plasma may be of benefit in some patients with COVID-19
[18,19]. Specifically, in a Chinese study of 5 critically-ill COVID-19 patients on mechanical
ventilation, a one-time administration of convalescent plasma resulted in clinical
improvement of all patients, with 3 patients being weaned off mechanical ventilation within
As of April 19, 2020, there were 5 registered convalescent plasma therapy clinical trials in
COVID-19 convalescent plasma can be isolated from the blood of patients who have
recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and are believed to have developed humoral
immunity against the virus. The collected convalescent plasma can then be transfused into
ABO compatible severe or critically ill patients with active COVID-19.

Vaccine Trials
Effective vaccination to a large portion of the world’s population is needed to effectively end
the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19
outbreak as a pandemic in early March, tremendous effort and funding have been allocated
to developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. DNA and RNA-based vaccine platforms can
ramp up production rapidly as no cell incubation is required. Developing recombinantsubunit vaccines require cell culture or fermentation process which can take longer.
Currently multiple development platforms are being utilized [20]. Experts estimate that it
can take 12–18 months to develop a successful vaccine ready for the general population.
There are currently as many as 70 vaccine candidates in the preclinical stage. Some of the
Bacillus Calmete-Guerin (BCG), a live attenuated vaccine originally used against
tuberculosis, is being repurposed against SARS-COV-2. There are several ongoing phase III
clinical trials internationally (NCT04327206, NCT04348370, NCT04328441) recruiting
healthcare workers as participants.
Ad5-nCoV is an adenovirus type-5 vector-based recombinant vaccine engineered to produce
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein developed by CanSino Biologics in China. The vaccine
completed recruitment for the phase I trial (single center, open label, dose escalation) in
China. It has commenced to a double-blind, phase II RCT (NCT04341389) and plan to
enroll 500 healthy subjects.
(NCT04283461) is now recruiting candidates across the United States. The vaccine
candidate was developed by ModernaTX and supported by NIH.
I/II single-blinded, RCT (NCT04324606). The study involves 3 arms with 5 interventions.
The study plans to recruit 510 healthy volunteers in England.
INO-4800, a DNA vaccine candidate developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, is being studied
in an open-label phase I trial (NCT04336410) to evaluate the safe, tolerability and
immunogenicity of the vaccine. The vaccine is administered intradermally followed by
electroporation. It plans to recruit 40 healthy volunteers in the United States.
LV vaccine (LV-SMENP) is made by modifying dendritic cells with lentivirus vector
expressing COVID-19 minigene protein from Covid-19 to activate T cells. The phase I/II
study (NCT04276896) plans to recruit 100 participants in Shenzhen, China.
COVID-19 in Cancer Patients
Patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable with increased mortality associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to the general population. Cancer patients are typically
Chi et al.
immunosuppressed with high healthcare utilization requirements which likely contributes to
high transmission rates and poorer outcomes. Both Chinese and Italian data demonstrated
that the mortality rate of cancer patients with COVID 19 were 39% and 20% although the
sample size was smaller with different demographics [21,22]. Both the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Society of Hematology (ASH) have provided
institutional policy recommendations to guide the timing of initiation of treatment and
alternatives to standard treatment regimens during this time when resources are limited and
risk of potentially life-threatening COVID-19 infection is high. In addition, the FDA has
provided general guidance as to the management of clinical trials during the pandemic,
many of which are no longer accruing or temporarily on hold. At the present time, cancer
patients are eligible for the vast majority of COVID-19 clinical trials regardless of cancer
directed treatment status. In the United States there are currently 2 intervention studies
specifically designed for cancer patients and there are 8 observational studies specifically
The COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc across the world, causing high number of
morbidities and mortalities. It is the greatest global health crisis of our generation. The case
fatality rate is estimated to be 3 – 10%. However, given the extremely high infectious rate,
there are now over 2.5 million confirmed cases with staggering 175,000 deaths worldwide as
of April 20, 2020. For oncology patients with COVID-19, the case fatality rate is even
higher, especially those who are on active chemotherapy treatment. The mortality rate of
hospitalized COVID-19 cancer patients can be as high as 30% (our own institutional data;
n=30). Heath care centers across the globe are using various agents to treat COVID-19 as
there are no effective therapies to date with strong evidence. However, it is encouraging to
see the high volume and speed of the ongoing clinical trials. High quality evidence-based
guidelines are needed urgently to standardize the treatment of COVID-19 especially for this
vulnerable oncology patient population.
This study is supported by US NIH grants 2UG1CA189850.
