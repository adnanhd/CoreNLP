The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health crisis. Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread
from individuals with pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections [1, 2, 3], the
re-opening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust surveillance,
for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are usually too low to detect, followed by an exponential growth
of virus, leading to a peak viral load and infectiousness, and ending with declining viral levels
and clearance [4]. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics [4], we model surveillance effectiveness considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results
demonstrate that effective surveillance, including time to first detection and outbreak control, depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved
by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that surveillance should prioritize accessibility,
frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.
The reliance on testing as a means to safely reopen societies has placed a microscope on the
analytical sensitivity of virus assays, with a gold-standard of quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR). These assays have analytical limits of detection that are usually within
around 103 viral RNA copies per ml (cp/ml) [5]. However, qPCR remains expensive and as a
laboratory based assay often have sample-to-result times of 24-48 hours. New developments in
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics have the potential to reduce cost significantly, allowing for expanded
testing or greater frequency of testing and can reduce turnaround time to minutes. These assays
however largely do not meet the gold standard for analytical sensitivity, which has encumbered
translation of these assays for widescale use [6].
Three features of the viral increase, infectivity, and decline during SARS-CoV-2 infection led us to
hypothesize that there might be minimal differences in effective surveillance using viral detection
tests of different sensitivities, such as RT-qPCR with a limit of detection (LOD) at 103 cp/ml [5]
compared to often cheaper or faster assays with higher limits of detection (i.e., around 105 cp/ml)
samples collected from patients displaying less than 106 N or E RNA cp/ml contain minimal or
no measurable infectious virus [7, 8, 9], either class of test should detect individuals who are
is likely due to (i) the fact that the N and E RNAs are also present in abundant subgenomic mRNAs,
leading to overestimation of the number of actual viral genomes by ∼100-1000X [10], (ii) technical
artifacts of RT-PCR at Ct values > 35 due to limited template [11, 12], and (iii) the production of
during the exponential growth of the virus, the time difference between 103 and 105 cp/ml is short,
allowing only a limited window in which only the more sensitive test could diagnose individuals.
For qPCR, this corresponds to the time required during viral growth to go from Ct values of 40 to
∼34. While this time window for SARS-CoV-2 is not yet rigorously defined, for other respiratory
viruses such as influenza, and in ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is on the order
of a day [14, 15]. Finally, high-sensitivity screening tests, when applied during the viral decline
accompanying recovery, are unlikely to substantially impact transmission because such individuals
detected have low, if any, infectiousness [10].
To examine how surveillance testing would reduce the average infectiousness of individuals, we
first modeled the viral loads and infectiousness curves of 10,000 simulated individuals using the
predicted viral trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections based on key features of latency, growth,
within-host viral kinetics, we calculated what percentage of their total infectiousness would be
frequencies. Here, infectiousness was taken to be proportional to the logarithm of viral load in
excess of 106 cp/ml (with alternative assumptions addressed in Supplemental Materials), consistent
with the observation that pre-symptomatic patients are most infectious just prior to the onset of
symptoms [4], and evidence that the efficiency of viral transmission coincides with peak viral
loads, which was also identified during the related 2003 SARS outbreak [16, 17]. We considered
that 20% of patients would undergo symptomatic isolation near their peak viral load if they had not

that there was little difference in averting infectiousness between the two classes of test. Dramatic

Above, we assumed that each infection was independent. To investigate the effects of surveillance
testing strategies at the population level, we used simulations to monitor whether epidemics were
contained or became uncontrolled, while varying the frequencies at which the test was administered, ranging from daily testing to testing every 14 days, and considering tests with LOD of 103
and 105 , analogous to RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP / rapid antigen tests, respectively. We used two
different epidemiological models to ensure that important observations were independent of the

To address whether these finding are sensitive to this modeled relationship, we performed similar

the reporting of a diagnosis. To examine how time to reporting affected epidemic control, we

The effectiveness of surveillance programs are dramatically diminished by delays in reporting in both the

of R were estimated from 50 independent simulations of dynamics (see Methods). (C, D) Relative to no

ulations, comparing the results of instantaneous reporting (reflecting a rapid point-of-care assay),
of viral spread and emphasize that fast reporting of results is critical in any surveillance testing.
These results also reinforce the relatively smaller benefits of improved limits of detection.
Communities vary in their transmission dynamics, due to difference in rates of imported infections
and in the basic reproductive number R0 , both of which will influence the frequency and sensitivity with which surveillance testing must occur. We performed two analyses to illustrate this point.
First, we varied the rate of external infection in our fully mixed model, and confirmed that when
the external rate of infection is higher, more frequent surveillance is required to prevent outbreaks
and C). This may be relevant to institutions like college campuses or military bases wherein fre-
quent classroom setting or dormitory living are likely to increase contact rates. Thus, the specific
strategy for successful surveillance will depend on the current community infection prevalence and
transmission rate.
Our results lead us to conclude that surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals can be used
to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, our findings are subject to a number of limitations.
First, the sensitivity of a test may depend on factors beyond LOD, including manufacturer variation
and improper clinical sampling [21], though the latter may be ameliorated by different approaches
to sample collection, such as saliva-based testing [22]. Second, our model assumed that no individuals would refuse testing. Both refusal and sampling-driven sensitivity issues can be accounted
for in estimates using a simple formula (see Supplemental Text), but a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between sampling-driven sensitivity issues and viral load, for instance,
would more accurately address this limitation. Finally, the exact performance differences between
testing schemes will depend on whether our model truly captures viral kinetics and infectiousness
profiles [4], particularly during the acceleration phase between exposure and peak viral load. Continued clarification of these within-host dynamics would increase the impact and value of this, and
other [19, 20] modeling studies.
A critical point is that the requirements for surveillance testing are distinct from clinical testing.
Clinical diagnoses target symptomatic individuals, need high accuracy and sensitivity, and are not
limited by cost. Because they focus on symptomatic individuals, those individuals can isolate such
that a diagnosis delay does not lead to additional infections. In contrast, results from the surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals need to be returned quickly, since even a single day
diagnosis delay compromises the surveillance program’s effectiveness. Indeed, at least for viruses
with infection kinetics similar to SARS-CoV-2, we find that speed of reporting is much more important than sensitivity, althoughmore sensitive testsare neverthelesssomewhat more effective.
The difference between clinical and surveillance testing highlights the need for additional tests to
be approved and utilized for surveillance. Such tests should not be held to the same degree of
SARS-CoV-2 assays. We suggest that the FDA, other agencies, or state governments, encourage
the development and use of alternative faster and lower cost tests for surveillance purposes, even
if they have poorer limits of detection. If the availability of point-of-care or self-administered
surveillance tests leads to faster turnaround time or more frequent testing, our results suggest that
they would have high epidemiological value.
Our modeling suggests that some types of surveillance will subject some individuals to unnecessary quarantine days. For instance, the infrequent use of a sensitive test will not only identify (i)
those with a low viral load in the beginning of the infection, who must be isolated to limit viral
the infectious threshold [9, 10]. Isolating this second group of patients will have no impact on viral
spread but will incur costs of isolation. The use of serology, repeat testing 24 or 48 hours apart, or
some other test, to distinguish low viral load patients on the upslope of infection from those in the
recovery phase could allow for more effective quarantine decisions.

Viral Loads
Viral loads were drawn from a simple viral kinetics model intended to capture (1) a variable latent
period, (2) a rapid growth phase from the lower limit of PCR detectability to a peak viral load, and
(3) a slower decay phase. These dynamics were based on the following observations.
Latent periods prior to symptoms have been estimated to be around 5 day [23]. Viral load appears
to peak prior to symptom onset [4], and peaks within 2 days of challenge in a macaque model [24,
25], though it should be noted that macaque challenge doses were high. Viral load decreases
3 or more days before symptom onset [1, 30]. Peak viral loads are difficult to measure due to lack
of prospective sampling studies of individuals prior to exposure and infection, but viral loads have
been reported in the range of O(104 ) to O(109 ) copies per ml [8, 28, 29]. Viral loads appear to
timing may differ depending on the degree or presence of symptoms [31, 32]. Finally, we note
that the general understanding of viral kinetics may vary depending on the mode of sampling, as
demonstrated via a comparison between sputum and swab samples [8].
To mimic growth and decay, log10 viral loads were specified by a continuous piecewise linear

the peak viral load. Peak height was drawn Vpeak ∼ unif[7, 11], and peak timing was drawn with

represents the time at which an individual’s viral load crosses beneath the 106 threshold, at which
point viral loads no longer cause active cultures in laboratory experiments [7, 8, 9], and was drawn
with respect to peak timing, tf − tpeak ∼ unif[5, 10]. In simulations, each viral load’s parameters
were drawn independently of others, and the continuous function described here was evaluated at

two opposing extremes. To capture a more extreme relationship between infectiousness and viral
load, we considered F to be directly proportional to viral load’s excess above 106 , i.e. F ∝
10log10 (V )−6 = V × 10−6 , and to capture a more extreme relationship, but in the opposing direction,
we considered F to simply be a constant when viral load exceeded 106 , i.e. F ∝ 1V >106 . We

the log-proportional infectiousness function, as visualized in Figs. 1 and 3. The proportional and
threshold models therefore represent one of many types of sensitivity analysis. Results for those
In all simulations, the value of the proportionality constant implied by the infectiousness functions above was chosen to achieve the targeted value of R0 for that simulation, and confirmed via
simulation as described below.
Disease Transmission Models
Two models were used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, both based on a typical compartmental
framework. The first model was a fully-mixed model of N = 20, 000 individuals with all-to-all
contact structure, zero initial infections, and a constant 1/N per-person probability of becoming
infected from an external source. This model could represent, for instance, a large college campus
with high mixing, situated within a larger community with low-level disease prevalence. The
second model was an agent-based model of N = 8.4 million agents representing the population
and contact structure of New York City, as previously described [18]. Contact patterns were based
on a combination of individual-level household contacts drawn from census microdata and agestratified contact matrices which describe outside of household contacts. This model was initialized
with 100 initial infections and no external sources of infection.
Both the fully-mixed and agent-based models tracked discrete individuals who were Susceptible
(S), Infected (I), Recovered (R), Isolated (Q), and Self-Isolated (SQ) at each discrete one day
timestep. Upon becoming infected (S → I), a viral load trajectory V (t) was drawn which included a latent period, growth, and decay. Each day, an individual’s viral load trajectory was used
to determine whether their diagnostic test would be positive if administered, as well as their infectiousness to susceptible individuals. Based on a schedule of testing each person every D days, if
an individual happened to be tested on a day when their viral load exceeded the limit of detection
L of the test, their positive result would cause them to isolate (I → Q), but with the possibility of
a delay in turnaround time. A fraction 1 − f of individuals self-isolate on the first day after peak
viral load, to mimic symptom-driven isolation (I → SQ), with f = 0.8 for the fully mixed model
and f = 1 for the agent based model. When an individual’s viral load dropped below 103 , that
individual recovered (I, Q, SQ → R). Details follow.
Testing, Isolation, and Sample-to-Answer Turnaround Times
All individuals were tested every D days, so that they could be moved into isolation if their viral
load exceeded the test’s limit of detection V (t) > L. Each person was deterministically tested
exactly every D days , but testing days were drawn uniformly at random such that not all individuals were tested on the same day. To account for delays in returning test results, we included
a sample-to-answer turnaround time T , meaning that an individual with a positive test on day t
would isolate on day t + T .
Transmission, Population Structure, and Mixing Patterns: Fully-mixed model
Simulations were initialized with all individuals susceptible, S = N . Each individual was chosen
to be symptomatic independently with probability f , and each individual’s first test day (e.g. the
day of the week that their weekly test would occur) was chosen uniformly at random between 1
and D. Relative infectiousness was scaled up or down to achieve the specified R0 in the absence
of any testing policy, but inclusive of any assumed self-isolation of symptomatics.
In each timestep, those individuals who were marked for testing that day were tested, and a counter
was initialized to T , specifying the number of days until that individual received their results.
Next, individuals whose test results counters were zero were isolated, I → Q. Then, symptomatic
individuals whose viral load had declined relative to the previous day were self-isolated, I →
SQ. Next, each susceptible individual was spontaneously (externally) infected independently with
probability 1/N , S → I. Then, all infected individuals contacted all susceptible individuals, with
the probability of transmission based on that day’s viral load V (t) for each person and the particular
infectiousness function, described above, S → I.
To conclude each time step, individuals’ viral loads and test results counters were advanced, with
those whose infectious period had completely passed moved to recovery, I, Q, SQ → R.
Transmission, Population Structure, and Mixing Patterns: Agent-based model
The agent-based model added viral kinetics and testing policies (as described above) to an existing
model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York City. A full description of the agent-based
model is available [18]; here we provide an overview of the relevant transmission dynamics.
Simulations were initialized with all individuals susceptible, except for 100 initially infected individuals, S = N − 100. As in the fully-mixed model, each individual’s test day was chosen
uniformly at random and relative infectiousness was scaled to achieve the specified R0 .
In each timestep, those individuals who were marked for testing that day were tested, and a counter
was initialized to T , specifying the number of days until that individual received their results.
Next, individuals whose test results counters were zero were isolated, I → Q. There was no selfisolation in this model (and accordingly, the model did not label individuals as symptomatic or
Then, transmission from infected individuals to susceptible individuals was simulated both within
and outside households. To model within-household transmission, each individual had a set of
other individuals comprising their household. Household structures, along with the age of each
individual, were sampled from census microdata for New York City [33]. The probability for
an infectious individual to infect each of their household members each day was determined by
scaling the relative infectiousness values to match the estimated secondary attack rate for close
household contacts previously reported in case cluster studies [34].
Outside of household transmission was simulated using age-stratified contact matrices, which describe the expected number of daily contacts between an individual in a given age group and those
in each other age group. Each infectious individual of age i drew Poisson(Mij ) contacts with individuals in age group j, where M is the contact matrix. The contacted individuals were sampled
uniformly at random from age group j. We use a contact matrix for the United States estimated
by [35]. Each contact resulted in infection, S → I, with probability proportional to the relative
infectiousness of the infected individual on that day, scaled to obtain the specified value of R0 .
To conclude each time step, individuals’ viral loads and test results counters were advanced, with
those whose infectious period had completely passed moved to recovery, I, Q → R.
Calibration to achieve targeted R0 and estimation of R
As a consistency check, each simulation’s R0 was estimated as follows, to ensure that simulations
were properly calibrated to their intended values. Note that to vary R0 , the proportionality constant
in the function that maps viral load to infectiousness need only be adjusted up or down. In a typical
SEIR model, this would correspond to changing the infectiousness parameter which governs the
rate at which I-to-S contacts cause new infections β.
For the fully-mixed, the value of R0 was numerically estimated by running single-generation simulations in which a 50 infected individual were placed in a population of N −50 others. The number
of secondary infections from those initially infected was recorded and used to directly estimate R0 .
For the agent-based model, the value of R0 depends on the distribution of infected agents due to
stratification by age and household. We numerically estimate R0 by averaging over the number of
secondary infections caused by each agent who was infected in the first 15 days of the simulation
(at which point the population is still more than 99.99% susceptible).
Estimations of R proceeded exactly as estimations of R0 for both models, except with interventions
applied to the the viral loads and therefore the dynamics.

Adjustments for false negatives and test refusal
When an infected individual is not diagnosed, due either refusal to participate in testing or due to
a false negative result unrelated to limit of detection—for instance due to an improperly collected
sample—the impact on a surveillance strategy’s effectiveness can be estimated as follows.
Let se be the test sensitivity, in the particular sense of the probability of correctly diagnosing an
individual as positive when that person’s viral load should, in principle, have provided a sufficiently
Let f0 be the total infectiousness removed with no testing policy, i.e. due to symptom-driven self
isolation. Let ftest be the fraction of total infectiousness removed with a chosen testing policy,
inclusive of symptom-driven self isolation, assuming that se = 1 and r = 0. Note that f0 and ftest
are the heights of bars in Figs. 1C and 3C, with f0 corresponding to the “no test” height and ftest
corresponding to a testing program. Under these assumptions, when se = 1 and r = 0,
Both f0 and ftest can be estimated rapidly via Monte Carlo to make this approximation by drawing
trajectories and applying a surveillance policy to them1 .
In this context, adjusting for false negatives and test refusal is straightforward. When se < 1
and/or when r > 0, this approximation can be modified. The probability that an individual is a
non-refuser and the test does not fail is se(1−r). Under the assumption of statistical independence
between refusal status, viral load, and se, the approximation becomes
+ 1 − se(1 − r) R0 ,
R ≈ se(1 − r)
which simply expresses a weighted combination of removed infectiousness between a successfully executed test and no test. Intuitively, note that if one plugs in r = 1 (complete refusal) or
completely failing sensitivity se = 0, then R ≈ R0 , as expected.
