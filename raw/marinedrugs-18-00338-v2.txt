Bioactive Indolyl Diketopiperazines from the Marine
Derived Endophytic Aspergillus versicolor DY180635
Yi Ding, Xiaojing Zhu, Liling Hao, Mengyao Zhao, Qiang Hua and Faliang An *
Abstract: Four new indolyl diketopiperazines, aspamides A–E (1–4) and two new diketopiperazines,
aspamides F–G (5–6), along with 11 known diketopiperazines and intermediates were isolated from
the solid culture of Aspergillus versicolor, which is an endophyte with the sea crab (Chiromantes
haematocheir). Further chiral high-performance liquid chromatography resolution gave enantiomers
determined by the comprehensive analyses of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HR-MS), and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculation. All isolated
compounds were selected for the virtual screening on the coronavirus 3-chymoretpsin-like protease
(Mpro) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the docking scores
with Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) after further studies.

Endophytic fungi refer to harmless parasitic fungi that live in the internal organs of plants
and animals without causing any adverse reactions. The host provides nutrients for endophytes,
and endophytes produce bioactive substances, giving the host an advantage in survival competition [1].
Symbionts coexist with symptomless fish, sponges, algae, and soft corals that grow in a relatively harsh
marine environment characterized by high salinity, scarce nutrients, and high osmotic and hydraulic
pressures, which provides many environment-specific microorganisms that could coevolve with their
hosts by undergoing the rapid and dynamic change of their genomes [2,3]. Thus, endophytic fungi are
considered as a treasure trove of unique structural compounds and bioactive metabolites.
Indolyl diketopiperazines (IDKPs), cyclic dipeptides produced by the condensation of l-tryptophan
and a second amino acid, were commonly isolated from fungi, especially from the genera Aspergillus and
Penicillium [4,5]. IDKPs had drawn considerable attention from synthetic chemists, natural products
researchers, and synthetic biologists for decades due to their significant biological activities, such as
antiviral [6,7], anticancer [8–10], immunomodulatory [11,12], antioxidant [13], and α-glucosidase
inhibitory activities [14]. Specifically, the vascular disrupting and tubulin-depolymerizing agent
plinabulin, a synthetic analog based on the natural diketopiperazine (DKP) product halimide generated
by the marine-derived Aspergillus sp. CNC-139, had entered the last stage of clinical study for the
treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer [15,16]. Since the first IDKP alkaloid chaetomin isolated
from the fungus Chaetomium cochliodes in the early 1940s, a series of DKPs and their biosynthesis
clusters were reported [17–22]. In our continuous investigations of novel bioactive agents from
the endophytic fungi [23,24], the endophytic strain Aspergillus versicolor DY180635 isolated from

3.2. Fungal Material
The endophytic DY180635 was isolated from a sample of crab (Chiromantes haematocheir), which
was collected from the intertidal zone of Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, in June 2018. It was incubated
on a potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate at 28 ◦ C. The strain DY180635 was identified using ITS rDNA
sequence analysis by RuiDi (Shanghai, China) and its DNA sequence using BLAST was compared to
the GenBank data. The result of BLAST searching was closest to that of Aspergillus versicolor NRRL
238 (GenBank accession number NG_067623) with 99% sequence identity. The nucleotide sequences
of the ITS gene (accession number MT361076) of A. versicolor DY180635 were deposited in GenBank.
A reference culture is stored in State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering laboratory of Shanghai
at −80 ◦ C.
3.3. Fermentation, Extraction, and Isolation
The fungus was incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 28 ◦ C for approximately
2–3 days; then it was cut into three agar pieces (nearly the size of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm) and transferred
into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, containing 200 mL of potato dextrose broth (PDB). The flasks were
cultured for 2 days at 28 ◦ C on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm for inoculation. The seed cultures were
added to the 200 × 1 L flasks containing rice medium (110 g rice, 120 mL deionized water), which was
previously sterilized at 121 ◦ C for 25 min. All flasks were incubated at 28 ◦ C for four weeks.
Following incubation, the solid rice cultures were extracted three times by EtOAc to give a crude
extract (489.0 g); the crude extract was suspended in water and then partitioned with EtOAc to give an
EtOAc soluble fraction (185.2 g) after the solvent was removed to dryness under reduced pressure.
The EtOAc fraction was further separated on macroporous adsorbent resin with a stepped gradient
elution with EtOH-H2 O (30, 50, 70 and 100%). The 50% fraction was sequentially separated by silica gel
with petroleum ether-EtOAc (5:1 to 0:1) to give four subfractions (A–D) using the TLC. The subfraction
B (9.0 g) was sequentially loaded onto silica gel CC (petroleum ether-EtOAc, 5:1) and preparative HPLC
(MeCN-H2 O, 50:50, 10.0 mL/min) to yield compounds 1 (10.4 mg, tR 34.9 min), 2 (6.4 mg, tR 27.1 min),
4 (5.9 mg, tR 33.5 min), and 6 (8.7 mg, tR 23.2 min). Subfraction C (15.0 g) was further separated by an
ODS column (MeCN-H2 O, 40:60) and repeated preparative HPLC with MeCN-H2 O (50:50, 10 mL/min)
to give compounds 3 (4.6 mg, tR 8.8 min) and 5 (4.7 mg, tR 17.1 min).

3.4. ECD Calculation
Monte Carlo conformational searches were carried out by means of the Spartan’s 14 software using the
Merck molecular force field (MMFF). The conformers with Boltzmann population of over 1% were
chosen for ECD calculations, and then the conformers were initially optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level in gas. The theoretical calculation of ECD was conducted in MeOH using Time-dependent Density
functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level for all conformers. Rotatory strengths for a
total of 100 excited states were calculated. ECD spectra were generated using the program SpecDis

3.5. Virtual Screening Against COVID-19 Main Protease
3.5.1. Protein and Ligand Preparation
COVID-19 [27]. Thus, the virtual screening was conducted by using the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme (PDB ID
optimized by using the protein preparation wizard module in Maestro software package (Schrodinger
LLC, NY, USA). Specifically, the water and heteroatom were removed, the polar hydrogens were added
to the protein to the protonation state, the entire structure was assumed as a neutral pH, and the
energy of the structure was minimized by using an OPLS2005 force field. The docking grid of 20 Å size
was generated over the co-crystallized ligand. All compounds 1–17 were implemented by Ligprep
software, and the structure energy was minimized using OPL2005 force field.
3.5.2. Virtual Screening
Virtual screening was performed by the Schrodinger glide docking module, and the standardprecision (SP) docking was designated to get accurate results [37]. The results were measured by
docking score, and only the compounds with scores in the top half were subjected to the extra-precision

The human monocytic cell line, THP-1 (Cell Bank of China Science Academy, Shanghai, China)
and P. acnes (ATCC6919, Xiangfu biotech, Shanghai, China), were used for the anti-inflammatory
assay. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, NY,
USA) in a humidified incubator (37 ◦ C, 5% CO2 ). P. acnes bacteria were incubated in Cooked Meat
Medium, containing cooked beef granules (Rishui biotechnology, Qingdao, China) in an anaerobic
environment. The THP-1 cells were stimulated by the P. acnes, which was harvested at the exponential
phase. The viability of THP-1 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay, specifically, seeding the THP-1
cells in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and treated with serially diluted compounds for
36 h (37 ◦ C, 5% CO2 ). After that, we added 20 µL MTT regent (5 mg/mL, Genetimes Technology Inc.,
Mar. Drugs 2020, 18, 338
Shanghai, China) to each well and incubated the samples at 37 ◦ C for 4 h. Removing the supernatant,
the formazan crystals were fully solubilized in DMSO (150 µL), and the absorbance was measured at
570 nm and 630 nm.
Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Aspergillus versicolor DY180635 led to the
isolation and identification of four new IDPKs, aspamides A–E (1–4) and two new DPKs, aspamides
F–G (5–6), along with 11 known diketopiperazines and intermediates. Further chiral high-performance
liquid chromatography resolution gave enantiomers (+)- and (−)-4, respectively. The structures and
HRESIMS, and ECD calculation. Compounds 1–17 were selected for the virtual screening on the 3CL
hydrolase (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, and compounds 1–2, 5, 6, 8 and 17 possessed top docking scores
