studies suggest that children may be less frequently infected or infect others,
however current evidence is limited. Prolonged faecal shedding observed in
studies highlights the potentially increased risk of faeco-oral transmission in

less likely to be infected compared to adults.

COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Children are less likely to develop severe disease from COVID-19 compared to adults, although the reasons for this remain unclear [1]. Despite the fewer
number of cases reported in children, there are concerns about asymptomatic or

Population setting: From January to 26 April 2020, virology laboratories at Charité and Labor Berlin screened
59 831 patients for COVID-19 infection, 3712 (6.2%)

Clinical characteristics: Positive PCR counts and percentages. Kindergarten (ages 0-6): n = 37 (2.10%); Grade

(nationwide), Retro- diatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese
were 728 (34.1%) laboratory-confirmed cases and 1407
(65.9%) suspected cases.
Demographics: Age: 1 day–18 years (mean: 7 years);
Gender: male n = 1208 (56.6%), female n = 927 (43.4%)
Clinical characteristics: Regarding the severity (including both confirmed and suspected cases), 94 (4.4%),
1088 (51.0%), and 826 (38.7%) cases were diagnosed as
asymptomatic, mild, or moderate, respectively; accounting for 94.1% of all cases. However, the proportion of
severe and critical cases was 10.6%, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1%,
and 3.0% for the age groups, 1, 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15,
and over 15 years, respectively. These results suggest that
young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Viral load distribution: Kindergarten (ages 0-6):
Adult (ages 26-4 5): n = 1247 (mean:5.23; SD:
1.87); Mature (age over 45): n = 2071 (mean:5.28;
SD: 1.95). The study found no significant differences in viral load exists between different age subgroups. However, there were smaller sample sizes
in the paediatric age groups.
Transmission route: Approximately half of the
patients were from Hubei province (981; 46.0%),
whereas 396 (18.5%) case patients were from Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shanxi and Chongqing, which border Hubei province. In the spatial
distribution, there was a clear trend that disease
spread rapidly from Hubei province to surrounding provinces and cities over time. There were more
children infected in the areas around Hubei province than in areas farther away except for Heilongjiang province. This study provided strong evidence
at the start of the outbreak of human-to-human
At least three studies have shown that children show prolonged faecal shedding compared to adults (and
well after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The researchers of one study also found that the viral
load of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract was greater and lasted longer than that in the respiratory system [9]. These findings lead to concerns about the potential for faeco-oral transmission of SARSCoV-2, particularly in infants and children who are not toilet-trained and who have poorer hand hygiene.
A study of 3712 COVID-19 patients analysed the variance of viral loads in patients of different age categories [10]. They initially reported a similar viral load in children as in adults [10], however, re-analysis
of these data show that young children (<10 years old) had statistically significant lower viral load [19].
It is estimated that the proportion of infected children with latent asymptomatic or with mild symptoms
of respiratory illness is higher than in adults, which highlights the possibility that children and young adolescents may be potential sources of undetected community transmission [3]. A nationwide case-series
of 2135 paediatric patients with COVID-19 reported to the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention found that more than 90% had asymptomatic (4%), mild (50.9%), or moderate (38.8%) symptoms [3]. This is a hospital-based study, which may underestimate the true rate of asymptomatic infection,
since many asymptomatic children are unlikely to be hospitalised or tested [3]. While there are studies describing the infective potential of asymptomatic adult cases [20,21], few describe this in children.

and siblings of infected pupils were also infected. However, it should be noted that almost all the students
in the study were aged 15-17 years of age, and appeared to have similar disease characteristics to young
adults. Therefore, the rate of infection reported might be not applicable to younger children.
One case report describes a paediatric patient who was infected during a holiday in France [12]. Despite
a large number of contacts in different classes after returning to the UK, the paediatric case did not transmit the disease to any other pupils.

transmission may pose a higher risk in children. Further investigation is required to confirm whether
have remained open. (iv) Children are infected, but perhaps less frequently than adults. However, these
studies are limited by small numbers and additional community seroprevalence surveys are needed to
confirm the proportion of children infected.
Direct evidence showing children as a source of transmission is scarce and largely based on small studies
or studies investigating few paediatric cases. We identified two studies indicating that children can transmit COVID-19 to other children or adults [4,5], however, these studies have a high degree of uncertainty.
The early case series of paediatric cases in China [4] (providing evidence on children as a source of adult
infection) has been questioned by the Swiss National Science Task Force group [22], who stated that a
check of the original data does not confirm the reported transmission from the infant to their parents.
transmission chains in such a widespread outbreak [5].
While there is lack of direct evidence on the frequency that children transmit the disease, indirect evidence
illustrates the potential risk of viral transmission by children. First, there is evidence showing that an infected infant contaminated (with SARS-CoV-2) the surfaces they were in contact with, thus rendering the
risk of transmitting the virus to caregivers through indirect contact with fomites [6]. This finding reinforces the need for caregivers of children to practice hand hygiene as recommended by the WHO. Second,
persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children raises the possibility of faeco-oral transmission. This potential is evidenced by at least three studies, which demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 may
be present in the gastrointestinal tract for a longer duration than viral presence in the respiratory system
[7-9]. Findings from these studies suggest that paediatric patients discharged on the basis of a negative
respiratory test may remain a potential source of viral transmission and indicate that further precautions
may need to be taken to avoid secondary infection during the convalescent phase. Third, several studies
reporting that children are more likely to be asymptomatic or mild symptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2
lead to the concern that children may transmit the virus to other groups covertly [2,3]. The possibility of
asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in adults by several studies [20, 21], while
studies specifically targeting the infectiousness of asymptomatic children are yet to be carried out. Future
studies aiming to understand children’s contribution to asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should
be given priority, as this will influence the balance of control measures for identification and isolation of
children and for tracing and quarantining close contacts.
infecting other pupils or staff members [12]. Data from both virus and antibody testing suggest that there
is limited evidence to suggest significant spread among children and from children to adults. This is consistent with studies showing the majority of infected children are related to family-cluster outbreaks and
showing low rates of infection in children [3,23].
Understanding the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children will help to determine children’s
relative contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community. Based on the infection rates reported from Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, and US [13-17], it seems increasingly likely that
there are comparatively fewer children with COVID-19 in the community, particularly younger children
under the age of 10. Data from these studies confirm that the percentage of children among the confirmed COVID-19 patients is small, varying from 1% in young children up to 6% in older children. It
should be noted that these studies are limited by the small numbers of children tested and the potential of biased non-random sampling. Better seroprevalence studies are therefore needed to understand
whether infection rates in the community are truly lower among children. The reason why COVID-19
seems to affect children less often and less severely than adults is not yet fully understood, but it could
lower chance of exposure, children are unlikely to have been significant drivers of the epidemic so far,
and there is not any evidence yet to indicate they are at higher risk of causing super-spreading events

Children are less likely to suffer severe and critical COVID-19 disease than adults [24], however, a
new paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has recently been identified in the UK, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. A small number of children
with diagnosed COVID-19 developed a significant systemic inflammatory response with a higher rate
of cardiac involvement, caused by a severe form of Kawasaki-like disease [25]. This condition could
be fatal and requires prompt and aggressive medical interventions. This has triggered the release of
a new guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health [26]. Research on this topic
is currently ongoing (DIAMONDS, ISARIC) and a new study from the British Paediatric Surveillance
Unit will be launching soon.

There is very limited evidence on paediatric cases acting as a source of infection, which highlights the
importance of obtaining robust data on transmission dynamics in children in future studies. Preliminary
infected or infect others. Further seroprevalence studies (powered adequately for the paediatric population), are urgently required to establish whether children are in fact less likely to be infected compared to
adults. Faeco-oral transmission appears to pose a higher risk of onward transmission in infected children
compared to adults, given the longer faecal shedding time observed in several studies. This may have
a high level of basic hygiene measures in these settings to limit spread.
